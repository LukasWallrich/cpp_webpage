# Part 1: Planning Data Collection
**Target duration: ~15 minutes**

## Narrative Arc
This opening part establishes the context (where we are in the consultancy cycle), introduces the fundamental tension between efficiency and thoroughness (inductive vs deductive), and explains *why* we collect data at all. The goal is to set up a mindset before getting into specifics: diagnosis is not a neutral activity; it's an intervention that shapes what the client discovers.

## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 1: Title Slide
**Content**: "Consultancy and Professional Practice - W3: Data collection and diagnostic issues"
- Brief welcome and overview
- "This week we move from contracting into the diagnosis phase—where consultants actively engage with the organisation to understand the situation before developing recommendations"

---

### Slide 2: The Consultancy Cycle
**Content**: The Consultancy Cycle diagram with data collection/diagnosis highlighted

**Figure**: Consultancy Cycle diagram with W3 section emphasised

**Key talking points**:
- Remind viewers where we are in the cycle
- Building on contracting (W2), now moving into discovery
- Diagnosis connects to what comes before (contracting sets the access) and after (findings enable recommendations)
- Key insight: the quality of your contracting determines the quality of your diagnosis

### Slide 3: This Week's Agenda
**Content**: Four-part structure

1. **Planning** data collection & analysis (Part 1)
2. **Data sources**—who and what? (Part 2)
3. **Methods** for data collection & ethics (Part 3)
4. **Going deeper** & dealing with resistance (Part 4)

**Key talking points**:
- Four video recordings, around 60 minutes total
- Written materials provide depth on specific techniques
- Some content is video + text; resistance section is text-only (more detailed)
- People analytics and AI approaches are written-only (optional enrichment)

### Slide 5: Block's Steps for Discovery (Block, 2010)
**Content**: Table showing Block's steps 3-9 of the consulting process

| Steps | Activities |
|-------|-----------|
| 3-6 | Define initial problem; Decide whether to proceed; Select dimensions to study; Decide who's involved; Select method |
| 7-9 | Do discovery; Funnel data and make sense of it; Provide results & recommendations |

**Key talking points**:
- Block provides a structured approach to discovery
- These steps are interconnected—choices about what to study shape what you find
- This is why contracting matters: you need access to the right people and information
- Note: these are steps 3-9, building on earlier contracting steps (1-2)

### Slide 6: Approaches to Diagnosis
**Content**: Comparison of Inductive vs Deductive/hypothesis-driven approaches

**Figure**: Visual showing the two approaches side by side

**Inductive ("boil the ocean")**:
- Start broadly, let patterns emerge
- Won't miss the best solution—if you ever get there
- Costly and time-consuming; often why consultants are brought in to avoid this

**Deductive/hypothesis-driven**:
- Start with hypotheses about what's happening, test them
- Efficient—if you start in the right area
- Risky—confirmation bias can lead you to find what you expect

**Key talking points**:
- Most consulting is hypothesis-driven for efficiency
- But this creates real risks: if initial framing is wrong, you may never find the real problem
- Experienced consultants balance hypothesis-testing with genuine openness to disconfirming evidence
- We'll mention confirmation bias again—it's that important

### Slide 6b: Action vs Research Approach (Block, 2010)
**Content**: Two-column comparison—related to the inductive/deductive distinction

**Figure**: Comparison table

| Research Approach | Action Approach |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Interested in ALL factors | Factors under client's control |
| Complete and comprehensive | Sufficient to decide what to do next |
| Do it alone | Client involvement throughout |
| Eliminate bias; focus on objectivity | Use feelings and perceptions alongside data |
| Neutral about outcomes | Deeply concerned about client's attitude |

**Key talking points**:
- This complements the inductive/deductive choice—it's about your overall stance
- Consultancy typically leans toward the action approach
- This isn't criticism of research—it's acknowledging different purposes
- You're paid for professional judgement and insight, not academic neutrality
- But don't use this as excuse for sloppy work—be efficient without being superficial
- This stance has implications for ethics, which we'll cover in Part 3

### Slide 7: McKinsey 7-Step Process
**Content**: Diagram showing where data analysis sits in structured problem-solving

**Figure**: McKinsey 7-step process diagram

**The 7 steps**:
1. Define the problem
2. Structure the problem (break into components)
3. Prioritise issues
4. Plan analyses and work
5. Conduct analyses
6. Synthesise findings
7. Communicate recommendations

**Key talking points**:
- Notice: data analysis (#5) comes quite late
- Early steps (define, structure, prioritise) shape what data you need
- This IS the hypothesis-driven approach in action
- You don't collect all possible data; you collect data that tests specific hypotheses
- Efficient—but only if your early framing is right

---

### Slide 8: Why We Collect Data
**Content**: Three distinct purposes (important to distinguish these)

**1. Build understanding**:
- *Discover*: what might be good solutions
- *Prove*: validate ideas we (or the client) already have
- *Gain clarity*: establish cause and effect
- *Learn*: insights about organisational culture—the deeper assumptions and beliefs

**2. Engage with the wider organisation**:
- Begin "unfreezing" and building momentum for change
- Note: the idea of "unfreezing" is often attributed to Lewin, but the three-step model largely post-dates him (Cummings et al., 2016)
- **Critical**: gathering data raises expectations—it's never "just" diagnosis

**3. Enable actions and improve things**:
- Block: Discovery's purpose is to *mobilise action*
- Not enough to understand something; you're paid consultants, not neutral scientists

**Key talking points**:
- These three purposes often sit in tension
- Gathering data is itself an intervention—changes what people think and expect
- Most important message: "Attention is selective"—your diagnosis is only as good as who you ask and what you ask them

### Slide 9: Part 1 Summary
**Content**: Recap and preview

**What we covered**:
- Position in the consultancy cycle: building on contracting, feeding into recommendations
- Block's structured steps for discovery (3-9)
- The fundamental choice: inductive vs hypothesis-driven
- Action vs research approach—consultancy leans toward action
- Three purposes of data collection: understanding, engagement, action

**The connecting thread**: Diagnosis shapes what you find. Your choices about approach, scope, and framing determine your conclusions before you collect a single data point.

**Reflection**: Do you tend to approach problems inductively or deductively? When has that preference led to success—or trouble?

**Written materials**: The online content covers Block's discovery steps and approaches to diagnosis in more detail.

**Preview of Part 2**:
- WHO should we collect data from?
- WHAT kinds of data matter?
- Schein's framework for understanding what to examine

# Part 4: Going Deeper and Managing Resistance
**Target duration: ~15 minutes**

## Narrative Arc
This part addresses the hardest aspects of diagnosis: uncovering root causes that lie beneath surface symptoms, and working productively with the resistance that inevitably arises. The arc moves from *techniques* (how to dig deeper) to *psychology* (why people resist) to *possibility* (reframing from problems to strengths). The goal is to leave students with practical approaches AND the mindset to apply them humanely.

## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 23: Agenda (highlight Going Deeper)
**Content**: Agenda with "Diagnostic techniques & resistance" highlighted

**Transition from Part 3**:
- "Part 3 covered methods and ethics, and how to feed findings back effectively"
- "Now we ask: why is surface-level data collection often not enough?"

---

### Slide 24: Why Surface Data Isn't Enough
**Content**: Set up the key insight

**Quote**: "Time spent on reconnaissance is seldom wasted." (Army maxim)

**Key talking points**:
- This military principle applies to consultancy
- Upfront investigation prevents costly mistakes
- But here's the problem: surface symptoms often mislead
- You need to understand underlying beliefs, values, fears
- This is WHY resistance occurs—changes violate things that matter to people

---

### Slide 25: Icebergs All Around (Hall, 1976)
**Content**: Two iceberg diagrams side by side

**Figure**: Corporate culture iceberg
- Above water: Job titles, Contributions, Formal structures
- Below water: Fears, Values, Beliefs, Non-verbal communication, Assumptions

**Figure**: Individual positions iceberg
- Above water: Opinions, "Evidence", Stated positions
- Below water: Hopes/Dreams, Experiences, Biases, Needs

**Key talking points**:
- Most of what matters is invisible
- Surface data (what people say, official documents) only captures the tip
- You need methods—and relationships—that reveal deeper layers
- This is why the "soft" skills of consulting are actually hard
- Let's look at techniques for going beneath the surface

---

### Slide 26: Root Causes—The Five Whys
**Content**: Toyota Production System technique for moving from symptoms to causes

**Figure**: Five Whys pyramid diagram

**Key concept**:
- Each "why" gets to a deeper level of understanding
- Move from symptoms to potential root causes
- Block (2010) similarly discusses "layers of analysis"

**Example walkthrough** (Kanbanize):
1. Problem: Website is down
2. Why? → Server crashed
3. Why? → Traffic spike
4. Why? → Marketing campaign launched without warning IT
5. Why? → No communication process between departments
6. Root cause: **Organisational communication breakdown**

**Key talking points**:
- Simple but powerful technique
- Stops you settling on superficial solutions ("fix the server" vs "fix the communication")
- Requires discipline to keep asking—it's uncomfortable to probe
- Five is a guideline, not a rule; sometimes 3 is enough, sometimes you need 7

---

### Slide 27: Transition—Why Diagnosis Triggers Resistance
**Content**: Connect techniques to psychology

**The paradox**:
- Deeper diagnosis is more valuable
- But it's also more threatening
- The more you uncover, the more resistance you may encounter

**Key talking points**:
- This isn't a failure of your technique
- It's a predictable response to having hidden things revealed
- Understanding this helps you respond appropriately

---

### Slide 28: Resistance is Data! (Mole, 2016)
**Content**: Reframe resistance as information

**Quote**: "Those who feel in a position of power (tend) to feel threatened by the expert power of advisers and therefore (may) discount good advice, even at the cost of poorer performance."

**Key talking points**:
- Resistance isn't an obstacle—it's information
- Tells you about power dynamics and concerns
- Expect it; don't be surprised by it
- The question isn't "how do I overcome resistance?" but "what is this resistance telling me?"

---

### Slide 29: Client Resistance is Normal (Schein, 1987)
**Content**: Explain WHY clients resist

**By seeking help from an outsider, clients feel vulnerable**:
- Guilt, anxiety, inadequacy from recognising things aren't working
- Fear of facing difficult issues (firing someone, making personal changes)
- Used to feeling in control—don't feel that now

**This vulnerability expresses as resistance**:
- Being secretive or guarded
- Reluctant to help
- Not revealing "real" problems
- Denying problems exist

**Analogy**: Your feelings going to an unpleasant doctor's appointment
- The anxiety, the temptation to minimise symptoms, the desire to be told everything is fine

**Key talking points**:
- Don't take resistance personally
- Understanding the source helps you respond with empathy rather than frustration
- This is normal, not pathological

### Slide 30: Clients Need to Keep Face (Schein, 1987)
**Content**: The core challenge

**Challenge**: How to produce change without client losing face?

**Three approaches**:
1. **Help clients regain status**: Build confidence in their own abilities through collaboration and recognition
2. **Create psychological safety**: So clients willingly give something up and are prepared to learn
3. **Ensure they feel in control**: Of what is happening

**Quote** (Randall, Burnes & Sim, 2019): "Even before their arrival, consultants can expect audiences that are less than reassured by their arrival; uncertain of the future; and suspicious of those brought in."

**Key talking points**:
- ALL data collection and feedback should support these goals
- Some client requests (e.g., performance feedback on specific employees) might undermine safety fatally
- May need to negotiate these tensions with sponsors
- This connects back to contracting—set expectations early

---

### Slide 31: From Doctor to Coach (Block, 2010)
**Content**: A different stance toward diagnosis

**Medical model**:
- Diagnosis → Prognosis → Prescription
- Consultant as expert who identifies what's wrong and prescribes cure

**Alternative—Focus on possibilities**:
- Reveal strengths to capitalise on
- Generate excitement for creating a new future
- Discovery and dialogue rather than prescription

**Key talking points**:
- The medical model can reinforce client helplessness
- Possibility focus mobilises energy rather than defensiveness
- Doesn't mean ignoring problems—means framing differently

---

### Slide 32: Positive Approaches to Diagnosis
**Content**: Two specific methodologies

**Positive Deviance** (Pascale, Sternin & Sternin, 2010):
- Look for solutions already existing ("invisible in plain sight")
- Find successful exceptions—people who've solved the problem
- Observe (don't just interview) how they do things differently
- Make them "evangelists of their own conversion experience"

**Appreciative Inquiry** (Cooperrider & Srivastva, 1987):
- What's working well worth sustaining?
- What dreams or visions exist?
- 5D cycle: Definition → Discovery → Dreaming → Designing → Destiny

**Key talking points**:
- Both approaches shift energy from problems to possibilities
- Particularly useful when clients are demoralised or defensive
- Building on what works is often easier than fixing what's broken

---

### Slide 33: Collect Your Own Insights
**Content**: Use yourself as a diagnostic instrument

**Your feelings and experiences are important data** (Block: "Everything counts!")

This gives insight into:
- How the organisation functions
- How they treat you may mirror how they treat their staff
- Your feelings offer clues to clients' real concerns

**What to note**:
- How do you feel: frustrated, bored, confused, excited?
- Client's body language, attention, openness to ideas
- How do they treat you: controlling, listening, interrupting?

**But: check your biases (cognitive and affective)**

**Quote**: "A good Consultant is like a 'Detective'" (Cockman et al., 1999)

**Key talking points**:
- Seek opportunities to shadow and observe at different levels
- Your reactions are data but need verification
- Cognitive biases from W2 apply here too
- Don't confuse your reactions with objective truth—but don't ignore them either

---

### Slide 34: Preparation for Live Session
**Content**: What students should do

**Before the live session**:
- Complete at least one core reading (Block, Harrison, OR Schein)
- Explore at least one diagnostic technique in depth
- Read the "dealing with resistance" written content (no video)
- Prepare notes on discussion questions

**Reflection**: When have you encountered resistance to change—in yourself or others? Looking back, what was that resistance trying to protect?

**Discussion questions to prepare**:
1. How can you reinforce the consulting relationship during data collection?
2. What are your Top-3 pitfalls to avoid?
3. What key ethical challenges need consideration?

**Note**: The written materials include additional depth on:
- Diagnostic techniques (Root Cause Analysis, Six Sigma)
- People analytics and AI-supported approaches (optional enrichment)
- Ethical considerations around data and algorithms

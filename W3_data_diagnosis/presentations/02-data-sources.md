# Part 2: Data Sources
**Target duration: ~12 minutes**

## Narrative Arc
With the planning mindset established in Part 1, this part addresses two practical questions: WHO should we collect data from, and WHAT should we collect? The arc moves from access (a contracting outcome) through stakeholder frameworks (Revans, Weisbord) to the types of data that matter. It closes with Schein's framework, which provides a lens for knowing *what to look at* in any situation—setting up Part 3's focus on methods.

## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 10: Agenda (highlight Data Sources)
**Content**: Agenda with "Data sources—who & what?" highlighted

**Transition from Part 1**:
- "Part 1 covered the planning mindset: inductive vs deductive, why we collect data"
- "Now we get practical: who do we actually talk to, and what are we looking for?"

### Slide 11: Who Should We Collect Data From?
**Content**: Access as the foundation

**Key opening point** (Block, 2010):
- "Access to key people and information are critical"
- How open is the client to let you into the "bowels" of the organisation?

**Link to contracting**:
This is why Week 2 matters. Your contracting conversation should have specified your "wants":
- Access to people and records
- Client involvement, resources, active support, time with them
- Your involvement in final decisions

**Key talking points**:
- Access promised in contracting may prove difficult to exercise
- Political dynamics can steer you toward some informants and away from others
- Be aware: what you're allowed to see may be curated

### Slide 12: Revans (1980) Framework
**Content**: Three questions to identify who matters

**Figure**: Visual of the three questions as overlapping circles (or Venn diagram)

**The questions**:
- Who **knows** about the problem?
- Who **cares** about the problem?
- Who can **do something** about the problem?

**Key talking points**:
- These three groups often don't overlap
- People with knowledge may not have power
- People with power may not care (yet)
- People who care may lack both knowledge and power
- Need to map stakeholders systematically—each group has different value

### Slide 13: Whole Client System Discovery (Weisbord, 1987)
**Content**: Engage the entire system, not just your immediate sponsors

**Key principles**:
1. **Complete stakeholder mapping**: understand who is affected across the whole system
2. **Representatives from across the system**: customers, suppliers, support people, different levels
3. **Continuity across phases**: ideally, same people involved in discovery, recommendations, AND implementation

**Quote** (Pascale & Sternin, 2005):
"Engage members of the community you want to change in the process of discovery, making them the 'evangelists of their own conversion experience.'"

**Key talking points**:
- People are more committed to solutions they helped discover
- This connects to change management—building buy-in through involvement
- Practical challenge: maintaining continuity is hard across project phases
- Weisbord has a talk available if students want to go deeper

### Slide 14: What Data Should We Collect?
**Content**: Types of data and the key distinction

**All kinds will be valuable**:
- Technical data, figures, workflow
- Behavioural and attitudinal/emotional data

**Four things you need insights into**:
1. The **nature of the problem**: what's actually happening?
2. The **client's own role** in causing or maintaining the problem
3. What **others** are doing to cause or maintain it
4. The difference between **presenting problem** and **real underlying problem**

**Key talking points**:
- Point 4 is crucial—clients often describe symptoms, not causes
- Surface issues vs root problems
- Part of diagnostic skill is distinguishing what clients SAY the problem is from what it ACTUALLY is
- Goal: gain ability to make recommendations that enable client to take next steps

### Slide 15: Schein's Content, Process, Structure Framework (1987)
**Content**: A lens for knowing what to examine in any situation

**Figure**: The Schein matrix

| | Task Issues | Inter-personal Issues |
|---|---|---|
| **Content** | Formal agenda, goals | Who is doing/saying what, to whom |
| **Process** | How the task is done | How members relate, communicate |
| **Structure** | Recurrent processes (SOPs) | Recurrent relationships, roles |

**Key insights for consultants**:
- **Inter-personal interventions** will be most personally threatening
- **Structural interventions** are likely powerful but most likely to be resisted
- Easy to get seduced by **Content** (the "what") but miss **Process** (the "how")
- Focus on **Task-Process** (how groups gather information, solve problems, make decisions) may be the most acceptable AND productive intervention

**Key talking points**:
- This framework helps you decide where to focus attention
- Don't just look at WHAT people do—look at HOW they do it
- Process issues often reveal the real problems
- Interventions on process are less threatening than structural changes
- Keep this framework in mind as you collect data—it tells you what to notice

### Slide 16: Part 2 Summary
**Content**: Recap and preview

**What we covered**:
- **Who**: Access is foundational; use Revans' three questions to map stakeholders; engage the whole system
- **What**: All kinds of data matter; the presenting problem isn't always the real problem
- **Framework**: Schein's Content/Process/Structure lens tells you what to examine

**The connecting thread**: Your data sources shape your diagnosis. Talking only to senior managers gives you one picture; talking to front-line staff gives another. Both may be incomplete.

**Reflection**: When have you seen important organisational knowledge held by people without the power to act on it?

**Written materials**: Explore the detailed breakdown of data sources and Schein's framework in the written content.

**Preview of Part 3**:
- HOW do we actually collect this data? (Methods)
- What are the ethical considerations?
- How to feed findings back effectively

**Close Part 2**

Part 1: Planning data collection
- Block's steps for discovery (steps 3-9)
- Inductive vs deductive approaches
- The McKinsey 7-step problem-solving process
- Why we collect data: understanding, engagement, and action

### Block's steps for discovery

:::summary
Block's [-@block2011] steps 3-9 for discovery:
- **Steps 3-6**: Scoping and planning
- **Steps 7-9**: Doing discovery, sense-making, recommendations

Your choices about *what* to study and *who* to involve shape what you'll find.
:::

| Step | Activity | Key Skills |
|------|----------|------------|
| 3-6 | Define the initial problem; Decide whether to proceed; Select dimensions to study; Decide who will be involved; Select the method | Scoping and planning |
| 7-9 | Do discovery; Funnel data and make sense of it; Provide results and recommendations | Data gathering and analysis |

This is why contracting matters so much. You need access to the right people and information.

### Approaches to diagnosis

:::summary
**Inductive** ("boil the ocean"): Start broadly, let patterns emerge. Thorough but costly.

**Deductive/hypothesis-driven**: Start with hypotheses and test. Efficient but risky if framing is wrong.

Most consulting is hypothesis-driven—beware confirmation bias.
:::

:::framework
**Inductive approach** ("boil the ocean")
- Start broadly, collect extensive data, let patterns emerge
- Won't miss the best solution, if you ever get there
- Costly and time-consuming. Consultants are often brought in to avoid it
- Appropriate when the problem space is genuinely unknown

**Deductive/hypothesis-driven approach**
- Start with hypotheses about what's happening and test them
- Efficient if you start in the right area
- Risky, as confirmation bias can lead you to find what you expect
- Appropriate when there's reasonable basis for initial assumptions
:::

Experienced consultants balance hypothesis-testing with genuine openness to disconfirming evidence.

### Action vs research approach

:::summary
Block [-@block2011] contrasts two stances:
- **Research**: comprehensive, objective, done alone
- **Action/consultancy**: focused on controllable factors, client-involved, sufficient for decisions

As a consultant, you'll lean toward action—accepting trade-offs in rigour.
:::

| Research Approach | Action Approach |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Interested in *all* factors that impact the situation | Interested mostly in factors *under the control of the client* |
| Being complete and comprehensive | Sufficient to help *decide what to do next* (completeness can be a hindrance) |
| Do it alone; don't need to involve the organisation | Client involvement is important at each stage |
| Eliminate bias and intuition; focus on objectivity | Use all your feelings and perceptions as well as hard data |
| Neutral about whether organisation likes outcomes | Deeply concerned about client's attitude towards the study |

Understanding both stances helps you choose deliberately rather than defaulting unconsciously.

### Guarding against confirmation bias

Several practical techniques help consultants avoid the trap of finding only what they expect:

- **Take resistance seriously**: When stakeholders push back on your emerging hypotheses, treat this as valuable data rather than obstruction. Their objections may reveal blind spots in your framing.
- **Pre-mortem sessions**: Before finalising your diagnostic approach, ask "If we got this completely wrong, what would we have missed?" This surfaces assumptions that might otherwise remain invisible.
- **Ensure diverse perspectives**: Deliberately seek out voices that might challenge your thinking. Use structured approaches like **devil's advocate** roles (assigning someone to argue the opposite position) or **de Bono's thinking hats** (systematically adopting different perspectives: facts, emotions, caution, optimism, creativity, process).
- **Separate hypothesis generation from testing**: Generate multiple competing explanations before collecting data, rather than settling on one hypothesis too early.

Michael I. Harrison examines the main features of organisational diagnosis and its uses in consultations for organisational improvement and change, focusing on three critical facets: process (working with organisation members to plan, administer, and provide feedback on diagnostic studies), modelling (using conceptual frameworks to frame issues and guide data gathering), and methods (techniques for collecting, analysing, and summarising diagnostic data).

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Diagnosis helps decision makers develop workable proposals for organisational change by assessing current state and discovering solutions to problems, though many ambitious change projects underutilise systematic diagnosis
- Diagnosis plays distinct roles in both organisation development projects and business-oriented change management, with applications ranging from freestanding diagnostic studies to integrated stages within broader change initiatives
- Three key facets determine successful diagnosis: process (establishing and maintaining cooperative client-consultant relations), modelling (using theoretical frameworks to guide analysis and interpretation), and methods (employing rigorous data-gathering techniques)
- Client-centred diagnosis enhances credibility and commitment but requires organisational cultures supporting open communication; consultant-centred approaches seem more objective but risk client disengagement from findings
- Diagnosis is particularly essential during turbulent times, helping managers avoid both inappropriate inaction and blind action by grounding decisions in careful analysis and enabling continuous learning through feedback loops

**Key insight**: Systematic organisational diagnosis provides essential grounding for managerial decision-making and change implementation, particularly when turbulent conditions create pressure for rapid action without careful analysis.

### The McKinsey 7-step process

:::summary
McKinsey's structured approach shows that data analysis comes *later* than expected—early steps (defining, structuring, prioritising) shape what data you need.

Hypothesis-driven: collect data to test specific hypotheses, not all possible data.

### Why we collect data

:::summary
Data collection serves three purposes:
1. **Build understanding** — discover, validate, learn
2. **Engage the organisation** — begin 'unfreezing'
3. **Enable action** — discovery's purpose is to *mobilise action*, not just understand
:::

**1. Build understanding**
- *Discover*: what might be good solutions
- *Prove*: validate ideas we (or the client) already have
- *Gain clarity*: establish cause and effect relationships
- *Learn*: insights about organisational culture (the deeper assumptions and beliefs within the organisation)

**2. Engage with the wider organisation**
- Begin the process of 'unfreezing' and building momentum for change (this concept is often attributed to Lewin, though the three-step model largely developed after his death; see Cummings et al. [-@cummings2016])
- Data gathering raises expectations; it's never "just" diagnosis

**3. Enable actions and improve things**
- Block [-@block2011] emphasises that discovery's purpose is to *mobilise action* to improve organisational functioning
- It's not enough just to understand something; you are paid consultants, not neutral scientists

### Attention is selective

A critical warning: our diagnosis is only as good as:
- **Who** we ask (and who we don't)
- **What questions** we ask them (and which we don't)

This is why the earlier sections on client relationships and contracting matter so much. If you don't have access to the right people, or if your framing excludes important perspectives, your diagnosis will be incomplete no matter how rigorous your methods.

:::reflect
Think about a situation where you had to understand a complex problem quickly. Did you take an inductive or deductive approach? What might you have missed?

## Overview

This week focuses on the **data gathering and diagnosis** phase of the consultancy cycle. Building on Week 2's contracting and relationship content, we explore how consultants collect, analyse, and feed back data to clients while managing resistance and navigating ethical considerations.

:::outcomes
- Identify key approaches to data collection and analysis
- Plan how to engage the client system in the data collection and analysis process
- Use effective approaches to feed back to the client and anticipate potential challenges
- Navigate key ethical issues when gathering data
- Balance the efficiency of hypothesis-driven approaches with the risks of narrowing down too quickly
- Understand opportunities and limitations of AI-supported approaches to diagnostic work

### Position in the consultancy cycle

We're now moving from the **initiation** phase (contracting, gaining access) into the **diagnosis** phase. This is where consultants actively engage with the client organisation to understand the situation before developing recommendations.

Remember: diagnosis is not a neutral activity. The questions you ask, the people you talk to, and the methods you use all shape what you find. Data collection is itself an intervention.

### How to use these materials

To prepare for the live session, you should:

1. **Watch the recordings** for each section (Parts 1-4, ~75 minutes total), and skim the written content that highlights key points
2. **Complete at least one core reading**: Block [-@block2011] Chapters 10, 11 and 13, OR Harrison [-@harrison2005] Chapter 1, OR Schein [-@schein1987] Chapter 2
3. **Explore at least one diagnostic technique in depth**: Root Cause Analysis, Six Sigma, or People Analytics
4. **Read the dealing with resistance section** in the written content for additional depth
5. **Work through the preparation checklist** at the end

The expandable academic source summaries throughout these materials are **optional enrichment**. They provide deeper context if you're interested, but aren't essential for the live session. The people analytics and AI-supported approaches section is also optional—particularly relevant if you're interested in HR consulting.

### Why these perspectives matter

Block writes as a practitioner offering normative advice on how to conduct discovery effectively. Harrison provides a more systematic academic framework for thinking about diagnosis. Schein emphasises the psychological and relational dimensions that underpin any diagnostic work.

Together, they cover the technical, systematic, and human aspects of gathering and making sense of data in consulting contexts. The specialised readings let you go deeper into specific methodological areas.

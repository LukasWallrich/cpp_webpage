## Prepare for the live session

### Preparation checklist

:::checklist
- Watch the four video recordings (~75 minutes total)
- Skim the written content sections
- Complete at least one core reading (Block Chapters 10, 11, 13 OR Harrison Chapter 1 OR Schein Chapter 2)
- Explore at least one diagnostic technique in depth (Root Cause Analysis, Six Sigma, or People Analytics)
- Prepare notes on the discussion questions below
- Read the group assignment brief
:::

### Discussion questions

Reflect on these questions and bring your notes to the live session:

1. **How can you reinforce the consulting relationship during data collection?** Think about specific tactics for building trust and maintaining collaboration during the diagnostic phase.

2. **What are your Top-3 pitfalls to avoid during data collection?** Drawing on the readings and your own experience, what mistakes should consultants be most careful to avoid?

3. **What key ethical challenges do consultants face during data collection?** Consider confidentiality, consent, privacy, and the power dynamics involved.

4. **What is the value of structured frameworks during diagnosis?** When are tools like the Five Whys, Root Cause Analysis, or Six Sigma helpful, and when might they constrain your thinking?

5. **What opportunities and risks come from AI/data analytics tools during data collection?** How should consultants approach these tools critically while still benefiting from them?

### Live session focus

The live session will be discussion-based rather than additional lecture. We'll explore:

- **Diagnostic approaches**: When to use inductive vs. deductive methods, and how to balance efficiency with thoroughness
- **Managing resistance**: Practical strategies for dealing with reluctant informants and guarded organisations
- **Ethical grey areas**: Where do consultants face genuine ethical dilemmas during diagnosis, and how should they navigate them?
- **Feedback challenges**: How to present findings in ways that enable action rather than defensiveness

### Assignment connection

As you work through this week's materials, continue developing your thinking about the assignment:

- What diagnostic methods would be appropriate for your assignment context?
- How would you plan data collection to understand the problem thoroughly?
- What resistance might you anticipate, and how would you address it?
- What ethical considerations would be relevant?

Read the assignment brief and some examples on Moodle if you haven't already.

### Looking ahead

Next week we move to **designing solutions**: how consultants develop recommendations based on their diagnosis and how they present these in ways that gain client acceptance.

Part 2: Data sources
- Who should we collect data from?
- Whole client system discovery
- What data should we collect?
- Schein's content, process, and structure framework

### Who should we collect data from?

:::summary
Access to **key people and information** is critical—how open the client actually is may only become apparent once you begin.

Revans [-@revans1980]: Who **knows**? Who **cares**? Who can **do something**? These groups often don't overlap.
:::

Your contracting conversation should have established access to key people and information. However, how open the client *actually* is to letting you into the bowels of the organisation may only become apparent once you begin. This is where the earlier work on relationship-building pays off.

:::definition
"Who **knows** about the problem? Who **cares** about the problem? Who can **do something** about the problem?"
Revans (1980)
:::

These three questions help you identify different stakeholder groups and recognise that they may not overlap.

### Navigating politics during data collection

Week 2 introduced organisational politics as a factor in contracting (Biggs [-@biggs2010]). These same dynamics shape what data you can actually collect:

- **Steering**: You may be directed towards certain informants and away from others. "You don't need to talk to that team" often signals political tension worth understanding.
- **Filtering**: People tell you what they think is safe to share. In low-trust environments, expect carefully curated responses that protect the speaker's position.
- **Coalition building**: Different factions may try to recruit you by feeding you their version of events, hoping it shapes your diagnosis.
- **Information control**: Key documents may be "unavailable" or heavily redacted. Access promised in contracting may prove difficult to exercise.

Awareness of these dynamics isn't about becoming cynical; it's about understanding why your data may be incomplete and triangulating accordingly.

### Whole client system discovery

:::summary
Weisbord [-@weisbord1987] argues for engaging the entire client system:
1. Map stakeholders across the whole system
2. Get representatives from inside *and* outside
3. Maintain continuity across phases

Involving people in discovery makes them "evangelists of their own conversion experience."
:::

1. **Stakeholder mapping**: understand who is affected and impacted across the whole system
2. **Representatives across the system**: get engagement from inside and outside the organisation (customers, suppliers, support people, different levels)
3. **Continuity across phases**: ideally, the same people should be involved in discovery, making recommendations, *and* implementing the change [@block2011]

Pascale and Sternin's [-@pascalesternin2005] "positive deviance" approach is relevant here: engaging members of the community you want to change in the process of discovery makes them "evangelists of their own conversion experience." People are more committed to solutions they helped discover than to solutions presented by outsiders. For more on positive deviance and related approaches, see the [dealing with resistance section](#part4).

:::source[weisbord2013]
*Summarised from video transcript.* In this talk, Weisbord traces the evolution of consulting practice from Frederick Taylor's scientific management (1900) through group problem-solving (1940s–50s) and expert systems improvement (1960s) to "everybody improving whole systems"—his learning curve framework. He recounts discovering at Bethlehem Steel that Taylor's century-old systems had become the very problems consultants were hired to solve, and notes how Taylor's humanistic values were divorced from his techniques, leaving only time-and-motion study. Drawing on Ron Lippitt's finding that problem-solving depresses people, Weisbord advocates for "images of potential" and whole-system conferences that bring cross-sections of entire communities together.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Taylor's original aim was reducing waste of human resources and enabling dignity at work, but his successors kept only the techniques while discarding the values
- The paradigm shift from expert-driven to participatory methods began with the discovery of group dynamics in the 1930s–40s, establishing that democratic leadership produces higher productivity and commitment
- Expert systems thinking (1960s) enabled sophisticated analysis but could not secure the hearts of the people whose commitment was needed for change
- When a cross-section of a whole system gathers in one room, everybody collectively knows more than any individual knew going in, enabling solutions at levels previously impossible
- The "Future Search" method emerged from this insight: bringing 40–300 people together to work on shared images of potential rather than problem-solving

**Key insight**: Unless you involve everybody in the system in thinking about how to improve the whole, you won't succeed in creating lasting change—getting the whole system in the room transforms what's possible.

### What data should we collect?

:::summary
Collect technical data *and* behavioural, attitudinal, emotional data. Key insights needed:
- The nature of the problem
- The client's own role in causing/maintaining it
- **The difference between presenting and underlying problems**

Clients often describe symptoms rather than causes.
:::

Data of all kinds will be potentially valuable: technical data, figures and workflow, as well as behavioural, attitudinal, and emotional data. You need insights into:

- **The nature of the problem**: what's actually happening?
- **The client's own role** in causing or maintaining the problem
- **What others are doing** to cause or maintain it
- **The difference between the presenting problem and the real underlying problem**

This last point is crucial. Clients often describe symptoms rather than causes, or surface issues rather than root problems. Part of diagnostic skill is distinguishing between what clients *say* the problem is and what the problem *actually* is.

### Schein's content, process, and structure framework

:::summary
Schein [-@schein1987]: Three elements × two dimensions:
- **Content** / **Process** / **Structure**
- **Task** / **Inter-personal**

Inter-personal interventions = most threatening. Structural = most powerful but resisted.
**Task-Process** focus is often the most acceptable *and* productive.
:::

In any situation, three main elements are at work: **Content**, **Process**, and **Structure**. For each, there are two types of issues: **Task** and **Inter-personal**.

| | Task Issues | Inter-personal Issues |
|---|---|---|
| **Content** | Formal agenda, goals | Who is doing/saying what, to whom |
| **Process** | How the task is done | How members relate to each other, communicate |
| **Structure** | Recurrent processes (standard operating procedures) | Recurrent inter-personal relationships, roles played |

When intervening, consultants need to remember:

- **Inter-personal interventions** will be the most personally threatening
- **Structural interventions** are likely to be powerful, but also most likely to be resisted
- It's very easy to get seduced by the **Content** of a problem (the 'what' being done) but then miss the **Process** of 'how' it is being tackled

A focus on **Task-Process** (the way a group gathers information, solves problems, makes decisions) may therefore be the most acceptable *and* productive intervention.

:::reflect
Think about a team or organisation you know well. What would you learn by focusing on *how* they work together (process) rather than *what* they're working on (content)?

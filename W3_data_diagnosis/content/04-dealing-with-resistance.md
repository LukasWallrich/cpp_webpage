Part 4: Going deeper and managing resistance
- Root cause analysis and the Five Whys
- Why clients resist (Schein's framework)
- Helping clients keep face
- From "doctor" to "coach": positive approaches
- Using your own insights as data
:::

Understanding and managing resistance is essential to effective data collection. This isn't about overcoming obstacles; it's about recognising that resistance itself is valuable data about what's happening in the organisation.

### Resistance is data

:::summary
Resistance isn't an obstacle—it's **information** about the organisation.

When people resist sharing, being interviewed, or engaging, that tells you something important about organisational dynamics.
:::

:::definition
"Those who feel in a position of power (tend) to feel threatened by the expert power of advisers and therefore (may) discount good advice, even at the cost of poorer performance."
Mole [-@mole2016]
:::

When people resist sharing information, being interviewed, or engaging with your process, that tells you something important about the organisational dynamics you're trying to understand.

### Schein: client resistance is normal

:::summary
Schein [-@schein1987]: By seeking outside help, clients feel **vulnerable**:
- Guilt, anxiety, inadequacy
- Fear of facing difficult issues
- Loss of control

Resistance is a natural expression of that vulnerability.
:::

By seeking the help of an 'outsider', clients feel **vulnerable**:
- Experiencing guilt, anxiety, or inadequacy from recognising that things aren't working as they should
- Fear of having to face up to difficult issues and risks, including the possibility of getting hurt in the process (e.g., having to fire someone, needing to make personal changes)
- They're used to feeling in control, and they don't feel that right now

**Resistance is a natural expression of that vulnerability.** All involved in the client system can demonstrate this in many ways: some direct, many indirect.

- Being secretive or guarded with information
- Being reluctant to help you
- Not revealing their 'real' problems
- Denying they even have any problems

:::reflect
Remember your own feelings when going to an unpleasant doctor's appointment. The anxiety, the temptation to minimise symptoms, the desire to be told everything is fine. Clients often feel something similar.
:::

### Clients need to keep face

:::summary
The challenge: **how to produce change without the client losing face?**
1. Help clients regain status and confidence
2. Create **psychological safety**
3. Ensure they feel **in control**
:::

The challenge for consultants is: **how to produce change in the client system without the client losing face?**

This involves:

1. **Helping clients regain status** and a new equilibrium by regaining confidence in their own abilities to solve their own problems (through collaboration and recognition)

2. **Creating psychological safety** so that clients willingly give something up and are prepared to learn something new [@schein1987]

3. **Ensuring they feel in control** of what is happening

Note: these goals may need to be negotiated with client sponsors. Some requests (e.g., performance feedback on client team members) might undermine psychological safety fatally.

**All data collection, analysis, and feedback activities should support these goals and recognise these issues.**

:::definition
"Even before their arrival, consultants can expect audiences that are less than reassured by their arrival; uncertain of the future; and suspicious of those brought in."
Randall, Burnes & Sim (2019)
:::

### From doctor to coach

:::summary
Block [-@block2011]: Move from "curing sick patients" to focusing on **possibilities**.

Two key approaches:
- **Positive deviance** — find what's already working well
- **Appreciative Inquiry** — access what 'dreams' or visions people hold
:::

Consultants often work within **medical models** (curing sick patients through diagnosis, prognosis, and prescription). But Block [-@block2011] suggests moving the focus from 'problems' to 'possibilities' can unleash energy:

- Reveal strengths to capitalise on
- Generate excitement for creating a new future
- A process of discovery and dialogue rather than prescription, to access the emotional and affective requirements needed for real improvement

Two approaches embody this shift:

:::framework
**Positive deviance** [@pascale2010]
Focus on what solutions already exist ("invisible in plain sight"):
- Look for positive examples where something is already working well (successful exceptions)
- Build and learn from these cases ('observe, not interview') by involving them in sharing and showing others how they do things

**Appreciative Inquiry** [@cooperrider1987]
- Identifying what is working well that is worth sustaining
- Accessing what 'dreams' or future visions are in people's minds
- A 5-stage process: Definition, Discovery, Dreaming, Designing, Destiny
:::

Both approaches shift attention from what's broken to what's possible.

### Collect your own insights

:::summary
Your own feelings in meetings are important data: "Everything counts!" [@block2011]

Insights into: how the organisation functions, how the client manages, their *real* concerns.
**But: check your biases** — reflect on how you feel and what you notice.
:::

Your own feelings and experiences of the client in your meetings are important data: "Everything counts!" [@block2011]

This gives valuable information about:
- How the organisation functions
- How the client works (similarities in how they manage you vs. how they manage their own organisation)
- If you feel like this, so probably will others
- The client's *real* concerns (which may differ from stated concerns)

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/Cockman1999.pdf -->
:::source[cockman1999]
Cockman, Evans and Reynolds provide a comprehensive guide to collecting and feeding back data in organisational consulting engagements. They argue that effective consultants must move beyond their narrow technical discipline to gather information about human dimensions of organisational problems, including feelings, relationships, and team dynamics alongside systems and procedures.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Consultants who focus solely on their technical expertise risk ignoring critical human process issues that significantly impact organisational problems
- Data collection should employ multiple methods: interviews, questionnaires, direct observation, document analysis, and intuitive responses
- Questioning techniques are central to consulting; client-centred consultants ask questions that illuminate problems for clients rather than merely extracting information
- Feedback is a crucial phase in consulting that must occur throughout an assignment, not just at the end
- Feedback should be constructive and balanced, including both positive acknowledgment of successes and honest discussion of failures
- Personal feedback requires a climate of trust and must be given with care, clarity and genuine intent to help
- Resistance to feedback often reflects emotional concerns such as feeling threatened, exposed, or blamed

**Key insight**: The success of consulting depends equally on handling the technical business problem and on the consultant's comfort working with human data (feelings, relationships and interpersonal dynamics), which are often the real barriers to change.
:::

**But: check your biases (cognitive and affective).**

Note and reflect on:
- How do you feel in meetings: frustrated, bored, confused, angry, excited?
- What do you notice about the client: their body language, attention span, anxiousness, openness to new ideas or fixation, constantly explaining or justifying, frenetic/hassled?
- How do they seem to treat you: controlling, with disdain, listening, constantly interrupting?

Seek opportunities to **shadow** or **observe** at different levels of the organisation: on the shop floor, in team meetings, as a customer.

### Additional reading: Evidence-based practice

Many substantive fields have their own diagnostic approaches that you can draw on:

- **HR/people analytics**: data-driven approaches to workforce questions (see the [people analytics section](#part6))
- **Lean management**: culture assessment, Value Stream Mapping for operations
- **Sector-specific benchmarking**: industry standards and comparisons

These established methods can provide rigour and credibility but should be adapted to the specific context rather than applied mechanically.

Think about a time when you encountered resistance in a professional context. With hindsight, what was the resistance telling you about the situation?

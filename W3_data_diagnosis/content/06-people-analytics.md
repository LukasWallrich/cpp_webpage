## 6. People analytics: a contemporary approach

**Note on relevance**: This section is particularly relevant if you're interested in **HR consulting** or workforce-related engagements. If your consulting interests lie elsewhere (strategy, operations, digital transformation), treat this as optional background. The ethical considerations around algorithmic decision-making have broader applicability.

People analytics represents a significant shift in how organisations approach workforce diagnosis. This section explores both the opportunities and the ethical challenges this creates for consultants.

### What is people analytics?

People analytics (also called HR analytics or workforce analytics) uses data and statistical methods to understand and improve workforce outcomes. Rather than relying on intuition or traditional HR practices, it applies the same analytical rigour used in marketing, operations, or finance to people-related questions.

Common applications include:
- Predicting employee turnover and identifying retention risks
- Analysing factors that drive engagement and performance
- Optimising recruitment processes and candidate selection
- Understanding diversity patterns and barriers
- Measuring the impact of training and development

DiClaudio, a Principal at KPMG Advisory Services, argues that workforce analytics represents a fundamental transformation in how HR creates value: shifting from a cost centre focused on administration to a profit centre that drives competitive advantage. The article frames this as an evolution from "descriptive and diagnostic" analytics (understanding what happened and why) to "prescriptive and predictive" capabilities (anticipating changes before they occur and recommending actions).

**Key findings/arguments**:

*The current state of HR analytics adoption:*
- KPMG's 2019 Future of HR survey found that only 37% of respondents felt "very confident" about HR's ability to transform via analytics and AI
- 60% planned to invest in predictive analytics within one to two years
- Among those who had invested in AI, 88% called it worthwhile, with analytics listed as the main priority (33%)
- However, only 20% saw analytics as a primary HR initiative, and just 12% cited it as a top management concern, suggesting a gap between potential and actual prioritisation

*Why now?*
- AI and machine learning enable the shift from descriptive insights to predictive, prescriptive, and adaptive analytics
- Cloud-based human capital management systems now come packaged with analytics and visualisation capabilities
- These systems enable integration of people data with other sources (e.g., customer relationship management) for a holistic business view

*Becoming future-ready: key considerations*
1. **Knowing which questions to ask**: Start by thinking holistically about the workforce: personal employee experience, customer engagement, and the work environment. The right questions determine which data sources matter most.
2. **Going beyond traditional metrics**: Look beyond engagement surveys and performance metrics toward unconventional inputs (calendaring data, travel management, time away from work, swipe card data, mileage tracking, conference call logs, and employer review site comments). Both structured and unstructured data can reveal how the workforce feels, thinks, and behaves.
3. **Workforce shaping**: Traditional workforce planning (matching skills to current openings) is insufficient given the pace of disruption. Workforce shaping uses advanced analytics to forecast future capabilities, working backward from possible future states to decisions that can be made today. This creates flexible workforce composition including full-time employees, contingent workers, and automation.

*How analytics transforms HR into a profit centre:*
- With AI, companies can evaluate workforce data against 30-40 criteria rather than just 3-4, enabling more nuanced, fact-based decisions
- HR can partner with customer insights groups to understand internal customer needs and design targeted employee training
- By positioning the right people in the right place at the right time, analytics boosts both talent retention and bottom-line success

*New skills required:*
- Data science capabilities integrated throughout the enterprise
- Professionals who can apply data insightfully to make impactful changes to business performance
- Individuals who can identify problems, assess solutions based on literature, analytics, and experience, and rigorously test solutions

**Key insight**: The companies that survive and prosper will be those that react quickly to employees' evolving preferences. Just as organisations now use analytics to understand customers, they must apply the same rigour to their workforce, making HR a strategic function that delivers insights, analysis, and competitive advantage through people.

### The promise and the problems

People analytics offers genuine benefits for diagnosis:
- **Objectivity**: data can reveal patterns that intuition misses
- **Scale**: analyse entire workforces, not just samples
- **Prediction**: identify problems before they become crises
- **Evidence**: ground recommendations in hard data

But it also creates significant risks, particularly around ethics and fairness.

Gal, Jensen, and Stein examine how people analytics create ethical challenges that hinder workers' ability to cultivate virtue and flourish in organisations.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- People analytics can create a vicious cycle of three interconnected ethical challenges: algorithmic opacity, datafication of the workplace, and nudging
- Algorithmic opacity prevents workers from understanding decisions about them, hindering their ability to develop skills and pursue excellence in their practice
- Datafication reduces workers to oversimplified data representations, preventing meaningful reflection on their actions and limiting capacity to develop practical wisdom
- Nudging manipulates worker behaviour without consent, reducing voluntary action and preventing ethical judgement development
- These challenges are not inevitable consequences of people analytics but arise from framing them as epistemologically superior to human judgment
- Organisations can mitigate these challenges by reframing people analytics as fallible companion technologies, establishing "algorithmist" roles for oversight, adopting hybrid quantitative-qualitative approaches, and designing systems that reveal uncertainty rather than false certainty

**Key insight**: Rather than abandoning people analytics, organisations should reframe them as imperfect tools requiring human scrutiny and oversight, complemented by qualitative insights and transparent design principles that preserve workers' capacity for reflection, voluntary action, and moral development.

### Implications for consultants

If you're working on a people-related engagement, you'll likely encounter analytics: either as a tool you're expected to use, or as systems the client already has in place. Key considerations:

**When using analytics:**
- Be transparent about what the data can and cannot show
- Check for bias in historical data (past decisions may embed discrimination)
- Consider privacy implications and employee consent
- Distinguish correlation from causation
- Present findings as one input to decisions, not the final answer

**When evaluating client systems:**
- Ask how the system was designed and validated
- Understand what data feeds into it and what's excluded
- Check whether affected employees have voice in how it's used
- Look for evidence of monitoring and correction

**Ethical questions to consider:**
- Does the use of this data respect employee dignity?
- Would employees be comfortable if they knew how their data was being used?
- Are the algorithms being used validated and fair?
- Who benefits and who might be harmed?

### Balancing rigour and relationship

Data-driven approaches can strengthen your diagnosis but shouldn't replace relationship-building and qualitative understanding. The best diagnostic work combines:

- **Quantitative data** that reveals patterns and scale
- **Qualitative insight** that explains why those patterns exist
- **Relationship skills** that enable honest conversations about sensitive topics

Remember: the goal isn't just to understand the problem. It's to understand it in a way that enables the client to act.

:::reflect
How comfortable would you be if your employer used analytics to predict your likelihood of leaving, your potential performance, or your "cultural fit"? How does that perspective inform how you'd use such tools as a consultant?

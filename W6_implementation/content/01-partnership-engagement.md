Part 1: Partnership & stakeholder dynamics
- Consultant roles during implementation: the shift towards Navigator
- Building capability vs. creating dependency
- How stakeholder positions shift during implementation
- Sustaining the five beliefs over time
- Implementation resistance vs. design resistance
:::

Implementation is where consultant recommendations meet organisational reality. The challenge: how do consultants enable change while ensuring the *client* owns it?

### The implementation gap

Good recommendations regularly fail to become reality. The gap between "what should happen" and "what does happen" has multiple sources:

The implementation gap emerges from:
- Recommendations that ignore political realities
- Solutions designed without client ownership
- Over-reliance on consultant expertise
- Failure to build client capability
- Poor handover planning

A useful diagnostic: at the end of a successful implementation, who will take credit? If the answer is "the consultant," something may be wrong. The best outcome is often when the client says "we did it ourselves."

:::summary
**Consultant roles and task ownership:** During implementation, the consultant role shifts towards Navigator, and task ownership becomes a critical issue.
:::

Earlier phases often call for Doctor and Advisor roles. Implementation demands more of the **Navigator**: helping the client steer through obstacles rather than telling them what to do. The Plumber role can be valuable for specialised work, but staying in it too long creates dependency.

Oncken and Wass's [-@oncken1974] "Who's Got the Monkey?" framework (from [Week 2](../W2_initiation/#part1)) highlights how tasks gradually migrate from client to consultant, because consultants have time and expertise, and it's easier for clients to delegate than learn.

Signs of unhealthy monkey migration:
- Client team waits for consultant input before acting
- Consultant doing work that client staff could do
- Client knowledge not increasing over time
- Growing consultant involvement rather than declining

The test is whether the client is **building capability** or **building dependency**.

### Building capability vs. creating dependency

:::definition
"The ultimate goal of consulting is to make the consultant unnecessary."
Paraphrasing Block [-@block2011]
:::

The consultant's dilemma: organisations hire consultants because they lack something: expertise, time, objectivity. The temptation is to fill that gap directly. The wiser approach is to enable the client to fill it themselves.

**Dependency patterns to watch for:**

| Indicator | Warning |
|-----------|---------|
| Recurring projects | Client hasn't learned from previous work |
| Expanding scope | Original problems weren't resolved |
| Exclusive knowledge | Only consultants understand the systems |
| Decision paralysis | Client won't act without consultant approval |

**Capability-building patterns:**

| Indicator | Positive |
|-----------|----------|
| Client-led meetings | Internal champions driving progress |
| Knowledge transfer | Client staff can explain approach to others |
| Independent action | Client implements without checking in |
| Declining involvement | Consultant's role naturally decreases |

### Planning with the end in mind

Effective implementation builds towards the consultant's departure from the start. Schein's [-@schein1987] process consultation model emphasises that the goal is always client self-sufficiency. Every implementation activity should pass the test: "does this build the client's ability to continue without us?"

The worst-case scenario is a client who has "completed" an implementation but has no internal capability to sustain it. The change quietly erodes, and the same consultant (or another) is hired to do it again. We'll return to the practicalities of handover and disengagement in detail in Week 7.

### Working with internal champions

Implementation rarely succeeds without internal champions, client staff who believe in the change and will carry it forward. Building these relationships is central to implementation success.

Internal champions need:
- **Visibility**: recognition of their role
- **Authority**: permission to act
- **Capability**: skills to drive change
- **Support**: access to consultant expertise when needed

Consultants can support champions by:
- Positioning them as owners of success
- Providing tools and frameworks they can use
- Building their confidence through coaching
- Ensuring their leaders recognise their contributions

Think about a change effort you've been part of. Who were the internal champions? What enabled or constrained their effectiveness?

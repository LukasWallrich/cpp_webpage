## Preparation

Use this checklist to ensure you're ready for the live session.

:::checklist
- Watched the video recordings for Parts 1-3
- Completed the core readings: Block Chapter 16 and Edmonstone on tame vs wicked problems
- Read the written content sections, especially the stakeholder management and planning frameworks
- Reviewed the five beliefs framework (from Week 4-5) and how it applies to sustaining change
- Considered how the implementation concepts apply to your team project
- Prepared questions or discussion points for the session
:::

### Preparation for your team project

This week's content is directly relevant to your team project. Consider:

**Partnership and engagement:**
- Who will own the change in your client organisation?
- How will you build capability rather than dependency?
- What's your exit strategy?

**Stakeholder management:**
- How might stakeholder positions shift during implementation?
- Who are potential internal champions?
- What communication approaches will sustain support?

**Planning and control:**
- What governance structure would suit your recommended changes?
- How will progress be measured and problems detected?
- What risks should be anticipated?

**Targets and sustainability:**
- How will you define success?
- What targets would be meaningful (and what might create perverse incentives)?
- How will the change sustain after your engagement?

### Discussion questions for the live session

Come prepared to discuss:

1. **Partnership:** How do consultants avoid creating dependency while delivering value? What signals would indicate unhealthy dependency developing?

2. **Stakeholder dynamics:** How do stakeholder positions typically shift between designing solutions and implementing them? What can consultants do when early supporters become blockers?

3. **Planning paradox:** When does detailed planning become procrastination? How do you know if you've planned enough?

4. **The 70% myth:** If the "70% of changes fail" claim is unsupported, what does meaningful success look like? How should consultants set expectations with clients?

5. **Exit and sustainability:** When should a consultant walk away from a failing implementation? What obligations do consultants have for the sustainability of changes they've helped create?

### Connecting to previous weeks

This week builds on several concepts from earlier weeks:

| From | Concept | This week's extension |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Week 1** | Consultant roles | Shift towards Navigator during implementation |
| [**Week 2**](../W2_initiation/#part1) | Who's got the monkey? | Task ownership during implementation |
| [**Week 2**](../W2_initiation/#part3) | Public sector | Implementation considerations for public sector |
| [**Week 3**](../W3_data_diagnosis/#part4) | Positive deviance, AI, Whole system | Application during implementation |
| [**Week 3**](../W3_data_diagnosis/#part4) | Resistance as data | Implementation resistance vs. design resistance |
| [**Week 4-5**](../W4_5_designing_solutions/#part3) | Five beliefs (Armenakis) | Maintaining beliefs over time |
| **Week 4-5** | Stakeholder mapping | Stakeholder dynamics during implementation |

### Looking ahead to Week 7

Next week covers **evaluation and closure**, including:
- Evaluating implementation outcomes
- Managing the end of consulting engagements
- Knowledge capture and transfer
- Follow-up and ongoing relationships

The sustainability concepts introduced this week connect directly to evaluation: how do we know if change has stuck?

### Reflection prompt

Before the session, spend a few minutes reflecting:

:::reflect
Think about a change you've experienced, either as part of the team implementing it or as someone affected by it.

- What made implementation succeed (or struggle)?
- Looking back, what would have helped?
- How does this experience inform how you'd approach implementation as a consultant?

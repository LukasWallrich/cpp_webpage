## Overview

This week focuses on the **implementation** phase of the consultancy cycle. Building on Weeks 4-5's work on designing solutions and creating readiness for change, we explore how consultants support organisations through the challenging transition from recommendation to reality.

:::outcomes
- Build 'partnership' and engagement within the client system to enable successful implementation
- Plan for effective stakeholder management and communication throughout the implementation process
- Design an effective approach to planning and control of the implementation process (including costing and project management)
- Critically think about setting targets and developing the business case for interventions

### Position in the consultancy cycle

We're now moving from **designing solutions** into the **implementation** phase. This is where the consultant's role shifts significantly, from analysing, recommending, and creating readiness to supporting the client organisation through active change.

By this point in the cycle, consultants should have:
- Explored and presented the real problems
- Triggered resistance (usually) and made the case for change
- Facilitated a decision on solutions (or steps towards it)
- Maintained clarity on their role: plumber, doctor, coach, or advisor
- Engaged clients and recruited advocates and change leaders
- Considered feasibility of implementation in solution design

The implementation phase is where these preparations are tested. Here, consultants face a paradox: they need to enable change while ensuring the client owns it.

### The implementation gap

A widely cited claim suggests that "about 70% of all change initiatives fail" [@beernohria2000]. As we'll explore in [Section 4](#part4), this figure has no valid empirical foundation [@hughes2011]. Understanding why this myth persists (and what the evidence actually shows) helps us think more clearly about what successful implementation looks like.

### How to use these materials

To prepare for the live session, you should:

1. **Watch the recordings** for each section (Parts 1-3), and read the written content that expands on the key points
2. **Complete the core readings**: Block [-@block2011] Chapter 16, and Edmonstone [-@edmonstone2010] on tame vs wicked problems in change management
3. **Review the stakeholder management and planning sections** in the written content for frameworks you can apply to your team project
4. **Work through the preparation checklist** at the end

The expandable academic source summaries throughout these materials are **optional enrichment**. They provide deeper context if you're interested, but aren't essential for the live session.

### Key themes

This week connects three critical challenges:

**1. Partnership over dependency**
How do consultants enable change without creating reliance on external expertise? The consultant roles from Week 1 (Plumber, Doctor, Advisor, Navigator) shift during implementation, with the Navigator role becoming especially important.

**2. Sustaining momentum**
The five beliefs framework from Week 4-5 (Armenakis) doesn't stop at readiness; it needs to be maintained throughout implementation. Stakeholder dynamics shift as change becomes real.

**3. Measuring what matters**
Setting meaningful targets and building compelling business cases requires understanding both the rhetorical function of targets and their practical limitations. Goodhart's Law reminds us that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

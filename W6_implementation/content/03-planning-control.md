Part 2: Planning and control
- The planning paradox: too much vs. too little
- Tame vs. wicked problems and "clumsy" solutions (Edmonstone)
- The four illusions of change management
- The consultant's role in planning and close control
:::

Implementation requires planning, but what kind? Consultants often need to help clients plan implementation without taking over the planning role themselves.

:::summary
**The planning paradox:** Too little planning leads to chaos; too much leads to paralysis. The solution isn't a middle ground but a different kind of planning altogether.
:::

There's tension at the heart of implementation: plans are essential, but rigid plans don't survive contact with reality. As the military proverb goes: "Proper prior planning prevents pitifully poor performance!", but the best plans hold direction firmly while holding detail loosely.

Key planning principles:
- Plan for **learning and iteration**, not just ticking off actions
- Focus on planning the **process** so attention can shift to content
- Value **improvisation within the plan**
- Expect the unexpected and build in flexibility

### The consultant's role in planning

The question isn't whether implementation needs a plan (it does). The question is *who plans* and *how involved* is the consultant.

| Approach | Consultant role | When appropriate |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Consultant-led** | Consultant creates and drives the plan | Specialised technical implementation |
| **Facilitated** | Consultant helps client team create their plan | Building client ownership |
| **Advisory** | Consultant reviews and advises on client's plan | Strong client capability |
| **Hands-off** | Consultant provides principles; client plans independently | Exit phase |

For most change implementations, the **facilitated** approach serves both effectiveness and capability-building goals. The consultant brings methodology and asks good questions; the client team provides knowledge and owns the output.

### Governance structures

Implementation needs clear decision-making structures. Governance answers the questions:
- Who decides what?
- How are conflicts resolved?
- What gets escalated and to whom?
- Who has authority to change the plan?

:::framework
**Basic governance structure**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Sponsor** | Ultimate decision authority; provides resources and removes barriers |
| **Steering group** | Major decisions; monitors progress; resolves cross-cutting issues |
| **Implementation lead** | Day-to-day coordination; manages teams; reports to steering group |
| **Workstream leads** | Specific areas of implementation; accountable for deliverables |
:::

The consultant sits *outside* this client hierarchy, but their position relative to it matters:
- **Too central**: Creates dependency; consultant becomes bottleneck
- **Too peripheral**: Expertise not accessible when needed; loss of value
- **Right balance**: Clear advisory role with agreed access points and defined responsibilities (methodology, expertise, capacity as agreed)

### Agile vs. structured approaches

**Agile methods** are an alternative to traditional linear ("waterfall") project management. Originally developed in software engineering, they are now widely used across industries for managing change [@rigby2016]. The core idea: instead of planning everything upfront and executing sequentially, agile works in short iterative cycles, learning and adapting as it goes.

| | **Waterfall** | **Agile** |
|---|---|---|
| **Planning** | Detailed upfront plan | Plan evolves continuously |
| **Delivery** | One big launch at the end | Small usable outputs every 1–4 weeks |
| **Feedback** | After completion | Built into every cycle |
| **Requirements** | Fixed at the outset | Expected to change |

:::framework
**Agile in practice: key rituals**

- **Sprints**: Short cycles (1–4 weeks), each producing a usable deliverable
- **Standups**: Brief daily check-ins: what did you do, what will you do, what's blocking you?
- **Sprint reviews**: Demonstrate what was delivered; get stakeholder feedback
- **Retrospectives**: What worked? What didn't? What do we change next time?
:::

Different implementation contexts call for different planning approaches.

:::framework
**When to use structured approaches:**
- Clear, stable requirements
- Multiple interdependent workstreams
- Regulatory or compliance requirements
- Large-scale rollouts where consistency matters
- External dependencies that need coordination

**When to use agile approaches:**
- Uncertain or evolving requirements
- Rapid feedback and learning needed
- Smaller, focused teams
- User/stakeholder involvement throughout
- Flexibility more valuable than predictability
:::

In practice, many implementations blend both:
- Overall structure for coordination and governance
- Agile methods within workstreams for flexibility
- Sprints for development work; milestones for stakeholder communication
- Planning horizons that get more detailed as they get closer

Edmonstone [-@edmonstone2010] sharpens this choice by distinguishing between **tame** and **wicked** problems. Tame problems have clear definitions and agreed solutions, so structured project management works well. Wicked problems are ambiguous, cross-cutting, and lack obvious right answers; applying rigid methods to wicked problems risks becoming part of the problem. Most organisational change falls into the wicked category, requiring what Edmonstone calls "clumsy" solutions: exploratory, incremental approaches that prioritise stakeholder negotiation over adherence to pre-set plans.

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/Edmonstone2010.pdf -->
:::source[edmonstone2010]
Edmonstone critiques the dominance of PRINCE2-based project management for organisational change, drawing on the distinction between "tame" and "wicked" problems originally proposed by Rittel and Webber (1973). He argues that most organisational change initiatives are wicked problems ill-suited to linear, rationalist project management methods, and advocates instead for "clumsy" solutions rooted in pragmatic negotiation and stakeholder collaboration.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Tame problems have clear definitions and agreed solutions amenable to structured project management, whereas wicked problems are complex, ambiguous, cross-cutting and lack obvious right answers, yet organisations habitually treat wicked problems as though they were tame.
- The NHS organisation development function has adopted a linear, target-driven, tool-based approach to change that neglects evaluation, reflexivity and sustainability, making it poorly equipped for genuine organisational development.
- Wicked problems require "clumsy" rather than "elegant" solutions: exploratory, incremental approaches that accommodate multiple stakeholder perspectives, expect surprises, and prioritise relationship-building and collective consent over rigid adherence to pre-set plans.

**Key insight**: Consultants must diagnose whether a change challenge is tame or wicked before selecting their approach; applying structured project management to a wicked problem risks becoming part of the problem rather than the solution.
:::

:::summary
**Close control:** Even with agile approaches, implementation requires close control.
:::

O'Mahoney and Markham [-@omahoney2013] emphasise maintaining close control during implementation. Control mechanisms serve to:

- Monitor that the project stays on track against the plan
- Spot problems early (emerging risks, unexpected developments)
- Enable quick, transparent responses (reallocate resources, reprioritise, implement contingencies)

This requires **strong governance** (clear ownership and escalation routes within the client organisation) and **strong change control** (clear processes to manage priorities and prevent "scope creep").

### Risk identification and mitigation

Every implementation plan should address risk. Common categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical** | Systems don't integrate; data quality issues |
| **Resource** | Key people leave; budget reduced; competing priorities |
| **Stakeholder** | Sponsor changes; resistance greater than expected |
| **External** | Regulatory changes; market shifts; supplier issues |
| **Timeline** | Dependencies delayed; scope creep; holiday periods |

Risk management involves:
1. **Identify**: What could go wrong? What would derail us?
2. **Assess**: How likely? How severe?
3. **Mitigate**: What can reduce likelihood or impact?
4. **Monitor**: What would we notice if this risk materialised?
5. **Respond**: What's our contingency plan?

:::reflect
Think about a project you've been involved with. What risks were anticipated? What wasn't anticipated? How were surprises handled?
:::

### Costing considerations

Implementation costs need realistic estimation for business cases. Three categories to consider:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 1.5rem;">
<div>

**Direct costs**
- Consultant fees and expenses
- Technology / infrastructure
- Training and materials
- Temporary staff or backfill

</div>
<div>

**Indirect costs**
- Client staff time (often underestimated)
- Productivity dip during transition
- Opportunity cost of not doing other things

</div>
<div>

**Hidden costs**
- Workarounds during implementation
- Extended support needs
- Addressing unexpected issues

</div>
</div>

Costing principles: include client time as well as consultant time; build in contingency (typically 10–20%); identify assumptions and sensitivities; phase costs against expected benefits; and be transparent about uncertainty.

### The illusions of change

Complexity theory highlights common illusions that lead to poor implementation planning:

:::framework
**Illusions of change management**

| Illusion | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| **Manageability** | Change is more complex than plans allow for |
| **Control** | Many factors are beyond anyone's control |
| **Linearity** | Change proceeds in loops and jumps, not steps |
| **Predictability** | The future remains uncertain; "best practice" doesn't transfer mechanically |
:::

The response isn't to abandon planning. It's to plan with humility:
- Build in sensing mechanisms to detect the unexpected
- Create decision points where the approach can be adjusted
- Ensure governance can respond quickly to new information
- Develop capability for improvisation within the plan's intent

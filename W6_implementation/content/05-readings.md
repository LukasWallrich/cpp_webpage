## Readings

Complete these readings *before* the live session. The questions below are designed to guide your reading; you don't need to write up formal answers, but come prepared to discuss.

:::reading[core][block2011] Chapter 16
Block's chapter on implementation addresses the crucial transition from recommendation to action, focusing on getting results and building client capability.
:::

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read Block with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What does Block say about the consultant's role during implementation?</li>
    <li>How does he suggest handling the tension between getting results and building capability?</li>
    <li>What advice does he give about extending influence beyond the immediate engagement?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

:::reading[core][edmonstone2010]
Edmonstone critiques the use of structured project management (PRINCE2) for organisational change, arguing that most change challenges are "wicked" rather than "tame" problems. This complements Block's practical orientation with a critical perspective on why rigid planning approaches often fail.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read Edmonstone with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What distinguishes "tame" from "wicked" problems, and why does this matter for implementation?</li>
    <li>Why does Edmonstone argue that PRINCE2-style project management is ill-suited to most organisational change?</li>
    <li>What would a "clumsy" (rather than "elegant") approach to implementation look like in practice?</li>
  </ul>

### Recommended readings by theme

Choose at least one of these depending on your interests:

#### Change approaches

:::reading[optional][pascalesternin2005]
Pascale and Sternin's HBR article on positive deviance explains how to find and amplify existing solutions within organisations. Highly practical with compelling examples. [Read via HBR](https://hbr.org/2005/05/your-companys-secret-change-agents)

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What is positive deviance and how does it differ from benchmarking?</li>
    <li>Why do Pascale and Sternin argue that community involvement is essential?</li>
    <li>How might you identify positive deviants in an organisation you know?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

:::reading[optional][weisbord2013]
Weisbord's video talk traces the evolution of consulting from scientific management to whole-system approaches. 27 minutes well spent. [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWpd1kRNxaQ)

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Watch with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>How has the consultant's role evolved over the past century?</li>
    <li>What does "getting the whole system in the room" mean in practice?</li>
    <li>What are the implications for implementation design?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::

#### Critical perspectives

:::reading[optional][hughes2011]
Hughes's analysis of the "70% of change initiatives fail" claim is essential critical reading. Understanding why this myth persists helps us think more clearly about implementation success.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What evidence (or lack of evidence) does Hughes find for the 70% claim?</li>
    <li>What functions does the myth serve?</li>
    <li>What would a more nuanced view of implementation success look like?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::

:::reading[optional][cummings2016]
Cummings, Bridgman and Brown's reappraisal of Lewin's change model challenges conventional change management wisdom. Reading this helps develop critical perspective on implementation frameworks. [Read via SAGE (Open Access)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0018726715577707)

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>How did the "unfreeze-change-refreeze" model develop, and what did Lewin actually say?</li>
    <li>Why does it matter whether our frameworks are historically accurate?</li>
    <li>What implications does this have for how we approach implementation?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Why these perspectives matter

Block writes as a practitioner focused on getting results while maintaining relationships. Edmonstone offers a critical perspective on why structured project management approaches often fail when applied to complex organisational change.

The critical readings (Hughes, Cummings et al.) challenge conventional wisdom and help develop the critical thinking that distinguishes thoughtful consultants from those who uncritically apply frameworks.

Together, these readings prepare you to think carefully about what implementation success looks like and how to design approaches that produce lasting change.

## 2. Stakeholder management

*This section is covered in the [Part 1 recording above](#part1), alongside the partnership and engagement content.*

Stakeholder dynamics change as change becomes real. The abstract support people expressed during diagnosis often wobbles when implementation asks them to do something different.

### Stakeholder positions shift during implementation

The stakeholder map you created during diagnosis is a snapshot. Implementation creates new dynamics:

:::summary
**Stakeholder positions shift** as abstract support meets concrete disruption, and power dynamics are redistributed.

A stakeholder who was a strong supporter might become a blocker when:
- Implementation affects their team more than expected
- Timeline pressures increase their workload
- The change conflicts with other priorities they care about
- They see colleagues struggling with the transition

Levina and Orlikowski examined how power relations shift during a consulting engagement through an ethnographic study of an internet consulting firm and its client. Drawing on Bourdieu's practice theory and genre analysis, they show how everyday communicative practices (meetings, workshops, presentations) both reproduce and transform power dynamics.

**Key findings**:
- Novel, ambiguous engagements create opportunities for marginalized agents to challenge established power relations by drawing on alternative approaches from other contexts
- When newcomers or lower-status participants adopt practices that help the project succeed (even if they violate organisational norms), they can shift power positions within their own organisations
- Consulting projects can disrupt power dynamics on *both* sides, not just in the client organisation but also in the consulting firm
- IT managers who were initially peripheral gained significant influence by leveraging the consultants' credibility problems

**Key insight**: Implementation creates "liminal spaces" where established boundaries blur and power relations become negotiable. Those who successfully resolve tensions, even by departing from official methods, may advance their positions.

Conversely, skeptics sometimes become supporters when:
- They see the approach is more thoughtful than expected
- Their concerns are genuinely addressed
- Early wins demonstrate value
- They're given meaningful involvement

### Maintaining the five beliefs

[Week 4-5](../W4_5_designing_solutions/#part3) introduced Armenakis et al.'s [-@armenakis1993] five beliefs framework for building change readiness. During implementation, these beliefs need to be **sustained**, not just created.

| Belief | Initial challenge | Ongoing challenge |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Discrepancy** | Is change necessary? | Is it *still* necessary? |
| **Appropriateness** | Is this the right change? | Is it *still* the right change? |
| **Efficacy** | Can we do this? | Can we *keep* doing this? |
| **Principal support** | Are leaders committed? | Are they *still* committed? |
| **Valence** | What's in it for me? | Is it *worth* the ongoing cost? |

Implementation fatigue erodes these beliefs. People who believed change was necessary at the start may question that belief six months in when progress is slow and costs are visible.

:::framework
**Belief maintenance strategies**

| Belief | Maintenance approach |
|--------|---------------------|
| Discrepancy | Remind people what the status quo cost; don't let memory fade |
| Appropriateness | Celebrate adaptations as responsiveness, not failure |
| Efficacy | Make early wins visible; provide extra support during hard phases |
| Principal support | Ensure leaders stay visibly involved, especially when things are difficult |
| Valence | Keep connecting activities to outcomes people care about |
:::

### Coalition building and maintenance

Implementation succeeds through coalitions: networks of people who support the change and work to make it happen. Building these coalitions requires ongoing attention.

**Building coalitions:**
- Identify people with influence (formal and informal)
- Find shared interests that the change serves
- Create opportunities for supporters to connect with each other
- Give people meaningful roles in the change effort

**Maintaining coalitions:**
- Keep communication flowing between coalition members
- Address concerns before they become grievances
- Celebrate collective achievements
- Manage conflicts within the coalition before they fracture it


:::summary
**Implementation resistance vs. design resistance:** Design resistance requires persuasion; implementation resistance often requires **support**.
:::

Resistance during implementation differs from resistance during diagnosis ([Week 3](../W3_data_diagnosis/#part4)).

**Design resistance** (earlier phases) involves questioning whether the problem is real, disputing the diagnosis, or challenging the proposed solution. **Implementation resistance** (current phase) looks different: struggling with new ways of working, competing priorities and limited capacity, fear of personal consequences, and attachment to old routines.

Implementation resistance is often less about the change itself and more about the *disruption* it creates. People may agree the change is good while still resisting because:
- They're already overloaded
- The timing conflicts with other pressures
- The new way is harder to learn than expected
- Their colleagues aren't cooperating

### Communication planning

Effective implementation requires systematic communication. Ad-hoc updates aren't enough when change affects many people over extended periods.

:::framework
**Communication planning matrix**

| Audience | Key messages | Frequency | Channel | Responsible |
|----------|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Senior sponsors | Progress, decisions needed, risks | Weekly | Brief + meeting | Implementation lead |
| Implementation team | Detailed progress, blockers, coordination | Daily/weekly | Stand-up, shared tools | Team leads |
| Affected staff | What's changing, timeline, support | Key milestones | Town halls, email, cascades | Internal champions |
| Wider organisation | High-level progress, success stories | Monthly | Newsletter, intranet | Communications |
:::

Communication principles during implementation:
- **Consistency**: Same messages through multiple channels
- **Honesty**: Acknowledge difficulties as well as progress
- **Two-way**: Create mechanisms for feedback, not just broadcast
- **Timely**: People hear news before rumours fill the gap

### The Pyramid Principle

Developed at McKinsey by Barbara Minto [-@minto2010], this framework structures communication for maximum clarity:

- **Lead with the answer**: State your conclusion or recommendation first
- **Group and summarise**: Organise supporting arguments into logical clusters
- **Logically order**: Present ideas in a sequence that builds understanding

This "top-down" approach contrasts with academic writing (which typically builds to conclusions) but works better in business contexts where readers want the key message immediately. During implementation, this matters because stakeholders are time-poor and need to grasp the essential message quickly.

:::framework
**Pyramid Principle in practice: a status update**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1.5rem;">
<div>

**Without the Pyramid Principle:**

"We held workshops with three departments last week and got good attendance from Finance but Marketing only sent two people. There were some issues with the new system's reporting module that IT is looking into, and we're also waiting for the vendor to confirm the training dates. On the positive side, the pilot in Finance went well and they've already started using the new dashboard. We think we might need to push the full rollout back by two weeks."

</div>
<div>

**With the Pyramid Principle:**

"We recommend delaying the full rollout by two weeks. The pilot in Finance succeeded (they're already using the new dashboard) but two issues need resolution first:

**Technical:** The reporting module has bugs that IT and the vendor are addressing.

**Engagement:** Marketing participation is low; we need sponsor intervention to secure their involvement before rollout."

</div>
</div>

The second version leads with the recommendation, groups supporting points logically, and makes the required decision clear.

How do you typically communicate: do you build to your conclusion or lead with the key message? Where might a top-down approach like the Pyramid Principle add value, and where could it backfire?

### Public sector considerations

Radnor and O'Mahoney [-@radnor2013] identified distinctive features of public sector consulting that become particularly salient during implementation ([Week 2](../W2_initiation/#part3) introduced their research on procurement and culture). During implementation:

- **Accountability structures**: Multiple layers of oversight can slow progress
- **Political sensitivity**: Implementation decisions may attract public scrutiny
- **Stakeholder complexity**: Elected officials, service users, unions, and regulators all have voice
- **Risk aversion**: Failure has higher visibility and different consequences
- **Procurement rules**: May constrain how implementation resources can be deployed

These don't make implementation impossible, but they do require different approaches:
- More emphasis on documentation and governance
- Greater attention to communication with external stakeholders
- Longer timelines with more checkpoints
- More robust contingency planning

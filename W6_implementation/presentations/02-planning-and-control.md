# Recording 2: Planning & Control

**Duration:** ~12 minutes
**Slides:** 1-8
**Core message:** Implementation needs planning—but the wrong kind of planning is worse than none. Consultants must diagnose whether they're dealing with a tame or wicked problem before choosing their approach, and plan with humility about what can be controlled.

## Slide 1: Title

**Visual:** Title slide

> "Planning & Control"

**Story to tell:**
There's a military proverb: "Proper prior planning prevents pitifully poor performance." Seven Ps. Hard to argue with.

But there's another military saying, from Eisenhower: "Plans are worthless, but planning is everything."

Both are true. And the tension between them is at the heart of implementation planning. You need a plan. But you also need to hold it loosely, because change rarely proceeds as planned.

This recording explores that paradox—and introduces a critical distinction that should shape every implementation approach you design.

## Slide 2: The Planning Paradox

**Visual:** Spectrum from "too little planning" (chaos) to "too much planning" (paralysis)

**Story to tell:**
Too little planning gives you chaos—wasted effort, preventable problems, people working at cross purposes.

Too much planning gives you paralysis—rigid adherence to a plan that doesn't survive contact with reality, endless preparation that delays action, and a false sense of control.

The answer isn't a middle ground. It's a different *kind* of planning. Plan for learning and iteration, not just execution. Focus on planning the process—who decides what, how we'll respond to surprises—so attention can shift to content as things unfold.

Think of it as building a navigation system rather than writing turn-by-turn directions. Directions fail when the road is closed. A navigation system recalculates.

## Slide 3: Tame vs. Wicked Problems

**Visual:** Two-column comparison with examples

**Story to tell:**
This is the most important concept in this recording. It comes from Edmonstone, who drew on Rittel and Webber's original distinction.

A **tame** problem has a clear definition, agreed-upon success criteria, and a known solution pathway. Implementing a new payroll system. Migrating data from one platform to another. Rolling out a standardised process across branches. These are complicated—but they're tame. You can plan them step by step.

A **wicked** problem is different in kind, not just degree. The problem definition itself is contested. Stakeholders disagree about what success looks like. The solution can't be separated from the problem—attempts to solve it change the problem. Improving organisational culture. Redesigning how teams collaborate. Changing how an organisation relates to its customers.

Edmonstone's argument—and this is his core point—is that most organisational change is wicked. Yet organisations habitually reach for project management tools designed for tame problems. PRINCE2, Gantt charts, critical path analysis. These tools assume a level of definition and predictability that wicked problems simply don't have.

**Key insight:**
Applying structured project management to a wicked problem risks becoming part of the problem rather than the solution.

## Slide 4: "Clumsy" Solutions for Wicked Problems

**Visual:** Elegant vs. clumsy solutions comparison

**Story to tell:**
So if structured project management doesn't work for wicked problems, what does?

Edmonstone borrows the concept of "clumsy" solutions from cultural theory. The term sounds pejorative, but it's not.

An "elegant" solution is clean, logical, and complete—but it assumes the problem is well-defined. A "clumsy" solution is exploratory, incremental, and adaptive. It accommodates multiple stakeholder perspectives. It expects surprises. It prioritises relationship-building and collective consent over rigid adherence to pre-set plans.

In practice, clumsy looks like: shorter planning horizons. More frequent checkpoints. Agile methods within an overall structure. Decision points where the approach can genuinely be adjusted—not just rubber-stamped.

This connects to what we said about partnership in Recording 1: clumsy solutions require genuine collaboration, because the solution is being discovered through implementation, not just executed according to plan.

## Slide 5: The Illusions of Change

**Visual:** Four illusions as a 2x2 grid

**Story to tell:**
Complexity theory highlights four illusions that lead to poor implementation planning. Let me walk through them, because they're traps I've seen consultants fall into repeatedly.

**The illusion of manageability**: the belief that if we just plan well enough, we can manage this. Change is more complex than any plan can capture.

**The illusion of control**: the belief that we can control the outcome. Many factors—market shifts, leadership changes, political dynamics—are beyond anyone's control.

**The illusion of linearity**: the belief that change proceeds in neat steps. In reality, change loops back, jumps forward, and detours sideways. The textbook sequence rarely matches the lived experience.

**The illusion of predictability**: the belief that we can forecast what will happen. "Best practice" doesn't transfer mechanically from one context to another.

**Key insight:**
The response isn't to abandon planning. It's to plan with humility. Build in sensing mechanisms. Create decision points. Develop capability for improvisation within the plan's intent.

## Slide 6: The Consultant's Role in Planning

**Visual:** Spectrum from consultant-led to hands-off

**Story to tell:**
A quick but important point about the consultant's position in planning.

There's a spectrum. At one end, the consultant creates and drives the plan—appropriate for specialised technical implementations. At the other, the consultant provides principles and the client plans independently—the exit phase.

For most change implementations, the sweet spot is **facilitated**: the consultant brings methodology and asks good questions; the client team provides knowledge and owns the output.

This connects directly to the capability-building argument from Recording 1. If the consultant creates the plan, the client doesn't learn how to plan. If the consultant facilitates the planning, the client develops planning capability alongside the plan itself.

The written content has more detail on governance structures—who decides what, escalation routes, decision rights. These are reference frameworks for your team project.

## Slide 7: Close Control (Briefly)

**Visual:** O'Mahoney & Markham's control principles

**Story to tell:**
One more essential point. O'Mahoney and Markham emphasise that implementation needs close control—even when the approach is adaptive.

Control serves three functions: monitoring that things stay roughly on track, spotting problems early, and enabling quick responses. This requires clear governance—ownership within the client organisation, not just the consultant—and strong change control to prevent scope creep.

Control is valuable for the consultant too. Without it, you find yourself managing blame rather than managing change.

The written content covers risk categories and costing in detail—these are reference materials you'll need for your team project's implementation plan.

## Slide 8: Summary

**Visual:** Three key takeaways

**Story to tell:**
Three things to take away.

First: diagnose whether your change challenge is tame or wicked before choosing your planning approach. This single distinction will save you from applying the wrong tools.

Second: plan with humility. The four illusions—manageability, control, linearity, predictability—are traps. Build in adaptation, not just execution.

Third: the consultant's role in planning matters. Facilitate rather than direct. Build the client's planning capability, not just the plan.

In the final recording, we'll look at how to know whether implementation has succeeded—and why the answer is more complicated than it seems.

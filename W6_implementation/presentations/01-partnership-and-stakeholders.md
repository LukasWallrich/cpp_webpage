# Recording 1: Partnership & Stakeholder Dynamics

**Duration:** ~18 minutes
**Slides:** 1-10
**Core message:** Implementation succeeds when consultants build client capability rather than dependency—and when they anticipate how stakeholder dynamics shift as change moves from abstract recommendation to concrete reality.

## Slide 1: Title

**Visual:** Title slide with module name

> "Partnership & Stakeholder Dynamics"

**Story to tell:**
This week we're in the implementation phase—where recommendations meet reality. And here's the uncomfortable truth: this is where most consultancy value is either realised or lost.

The diagnosis can be brilliant. The recommendation can be exactly right. But if implementation falls apart, none of that matters.

So what makes the difference? Two things above all: the quality of the partnership between consultant and client, and how well you manage the shifting landscape of stakeholders. That's what this recording covers.

## Slide 2: The Consultant's Dilemma

**Visual:** Paraphrased Block principle: "The ultimate goal of consulting is to make the consultant unnecessary."

**Story to tell:**
Here's the fundamental tension of implementation. Organisations hire consultants because they lack something—expertise, time, objectivity. The temptation is to fill that gap directly. You're good at this; the client isn't; so you do it.

But the wiser approach—and this is a central theme throughout Block's *Flawless Consulting*—is to enable the client to fill the gap themselves. The best outcome of a successful implementation? When the client says "we did it ourselves."

This isn't false modesty. It's the marker of genuine capability transfer. If the change only works while you're in the room, you haven't really changed anything.

## Slide 3: The Role Shift During Implementation

**Visual:** The four roles from Week 1 (Plumber, Doctor, Advisor, Navigator) with an arrow showing the shift towards Navigator

**Story to tell:**
Remember the four consultant roles from Week 1? Plumber—expert pair-of-hands. Doctor—diagnose and prescribe. Advisor—strategic partner. Navigator—guide through change.

During diagnosis and solution design, you're often in Doctor or Advisor mode: making sense of problems, designing recommendations. Implementation demands a shift towards **Navigator**: helping clients steer through the inevitable obstacles, delays, and resistance that emerge when change becomes real.

The Plumber role is still valuable during implementation—sometimes the consultant genuinely needs to do specialised work. But the danger is getting stuck there. If you're still the Plumber at the end of implementation, the client can't maintain anything without you. That feels productive—you're doing useful work—but it creates dependency rather than capability.

## Slide 4: Capability vs. Dependency

**Visual:** Two-column comparison: dependency indicators vs. capability indicators

**Story to tell:**
How do you know which pattern you're in?

Dependency looks like: the client team waits for consultant input before acting. The consultant is doing work that client staff could learn to do. Client knowledge isn't increasing over time. The consultant's involvement is growing rather than declining.

Capability looks like: client staff lead meetings. They can explain the approach to others. They implement steps without checking in. Your involvement is naturally decreasing.

There's a simple test: if you disappeared tomorrow, what would happen? If the answer is "everything stops," you've built dependency. If the answer is "they'd manage, maybe with a few stumbles," you've built capability.

**Key insight:**
The question isn't whether to take on tasks—sometimes you should. The question is whether the client is learning or outsourcing.

## Slide 5: Task Ownership Revisited

**Visual:** Monkey on a shoulder (callback to Week 2 image)

**Story to tell:**
Remember the "monkey" from Week 2—Oncken and Wass's idea that tasks migrate from the person who should own them to whoever is willing to pick them up?

During implementation, this dynamic accelerates. The consultant has time when client staff are busy. The consultant has expertise clients feel they lack. It's easier for everyone in the short term if the consultant just does it.

But every monkey that migrates to the consultant is a capability that doesn't develop in the client. And when the consultant leaves, those monkeys don't have anywhere to go.

Every implementation activity should pass the test: "is this building the client's ability to continue without me?" We'll cover the practicalities of handover and disengagement in Week 7—but the mindset needs to be there from the start.

## Slide 6: Transition — From Partnership to Stakeholders

**Visual:** Simple divider slide

**Story to tell:**
So far we've focused on the consultant-client partnership. But implementation doesn't happen in a bubble. It touches many people across the organisation—and that's where stakeholder dynamics become critical.

The stakeholder map you created during diagnosis? It's already out of date. Implementation changes everything.

## Slide 7: How Stakeholder Positions Shift

**Visual:** Before/after stakeholder map showing positions changing

**Story to tell:**
Here's what happens when change becomes real.

People who abstractly supported the change during diagnosis face concrete disruption. "Yes, we need to restructure" is easy to say when it's theoretical. It's very different when your team is being reorganised.

New stakeholders emerge—people whose areas are now affected who weren't part of the original conversation.

Power dynamics shift as the change redistributes resources, attention, and status.

And conversely, some early resisters may become supporters. People who were sceptical during diagnosis sometimes come round when they see the approach is more thoughtful than they expected, or when their concerns are genuinely addressed.

The key point: stakeholder management isn't a one-time activity. It needs continuous attention throughout implementation.

## Slide 8: Sustaining the Five Beliefs

**Visual:** The five beliefs table with "initial challenge" vs "ongoing challenge" columns

**Story to tell:**
In Weeks 4-5, we covered Armenakis's five beliefs framework for building change readiness. During implementation, the challenge shifts from *creating* these beliefs to *sustaining* them.

[Walk through the table, focusing on how each belief faces erosion]

The most vulnerable belief is often **efficacy**—"can we do this?" Early enthusiasm fades when implementation gets hard. People who believed they could manage the change start to doubt when they're six months in, progress is slow, and the daily grind of new ways of working is wearing.

**Principal support** is also fragile. Leaders are great at launching things. They're less good at staying visibly committed through the boring middle, when attention shifts to the next initiative.

The written content has specific maintenance strategies for each belief. But the overarching point: implementation fatigue is real, and the consultant's role includes helping the client system maintain its commitment when momentum flags.

## Slide 9: Implementation Resistance vs. Design Resistance

**Visual:** Two columns contrasting the two types

**Story to tell:**
In Week 3, we talked about resistance as data—something to understand, not overcome. That still applies. But the *nature* of resistance changes during implementation.

Design resistance is about the idea: "Is this the right change? Is the diagnosis correct?" It requires persuasion—building the case, demonstrating understanding.

Implementation resistance is different. People may agree the change is right and *still* resist because: they're already overloaded with other work, the timing conflicts with peak season, the new way of working is harder to learn than expected, or their colleagues aren't cooperating.

The response is different too. Design resistance requires persuasion. Implementation resistance often requires **support**—resources, training, patience, adjusting timelines. Treating implementation resistance as a persuasion problem ("they just don't understand") misses the point entirely.

**Key insight:**
If someone says "I agree this is the right thing, but I can't do it right now"—that's not resistance to overcome. That's a resource or timing problem to solve.

## Slide 10: Summary and Bridge to Written Content

**Visual:** Key takeaways and pointers to written content

**Story to tell:**
Let me pull together the threads.

Implementation succeeds through partnership, not control. The consultant's role needs to shift towards Navigator as implementation proceeds—guiding rather than doing.

Stakeholder dynamics shift as change becomes real. The five beliefs need maintenance, not just creation. And implementation resistance is fundamentally different from design resistance.

The written content goes deeper on several topics the recording only touched: exit planning checklists, communication planning, the Pyramid Principle for structured updates, coalition building, and public sector considerations. These are frameworks you'll want for your team project.

See you in Recording 2, where we'll tackle the planning paradox—and why rigid project management can be the enemy of successful change.

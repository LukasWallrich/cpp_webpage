## Readings

Complete these readings *before* the live session. The questions below are designed to guide your reading; you don't need to write up formal answers, but come prepared to discuss.

:::reading[core][block2011] Chapters 1-2
Block's book is a practitioner classic. These opening chapters establish his view of what consultancy is and what makes it effective. Pay attention to his emphasis on the *relationship* between consultant and client, not just technical expertise.

  </ul>

:::reading[core][sturdy2011]
This academic article provides a critical assessment of consulting's actual impact on organisations. It's denser than Block, but essential for understanding scholarly perspectives on the industry.

    <li>What implications does this have for how you'd approach consultancy work?</li>
  </ul>

### Why both perspectives matter

Notice that the two core readings represent different traditions: Block writes *for* practitioners, offering normative advice on how to consult well. Sturdy writes *about* consultancy from an academic, critical perspective.

Both are valuable. Block helps you develop practical skills. Sturdy helps you understand the context you're operating in, including why clients might be sceptical and why some consulting engagements fail.

Throughout this module, we'll move between these perspectives: developing practical capability while maintaining critical awareness.

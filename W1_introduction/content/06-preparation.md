## Prepare for the live session

The live session will focus on discussion, not additional lecture content. Come ready to engage with these questions:

- **What makes for an effective consultant?** Draw on the readings and your own experience.
- **What are the main differences between internal and external consultancy?** What are the advantages and challenges of each?
- **From the readings:** What most surprised you about consultancy as presented by Block, Sturdy, or O'Mahoney?
- **What should a "critical perspective" on consultancy focus on?** How might this help us as practitioners?

:::checklist
- Listen to or read through the three content sections
- Complete the Block chapters (or O'Mahoney alternative)
- Read the Sturdy (2011) article
- Review at least two of the academic source summaries that interest you
- Reflect on where you sit on the consultancy continuum
- Note any questions about the content for the live session

### Looking ahead

Next week, we begin working through the **consultancy cycle**: the stages of a typical consulting engagement from initial contact through to completion. Understanding this cycle will provide the structure for much of the rest of the module.

The stages we'll cover:
1. Entry and contracting
2. Discovery and diagnosis  
3. Analysis and solution development
4. Presentation and recommendations
5. Implementation support
6. Closure and evaluation

Week 1 has given you the context; the weeks ahead will develop the practical skills.

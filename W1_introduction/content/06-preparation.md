## Prepare for the live session

The live session will focus on discussion, not additional lecture content. Come ready to engage with these questions:

- **What makes for an effective consultant?** Draw on the readings and your own experience.
- **From the readings:** What most surprised you about consultancy as presented by Block, Sturdy, or O'Mahoney?
- **What should a "critical perspective" on consultancy focus on?** How might this help us as practitioners?

:::checklist
- Watch the videos and skim through the four content sections
- Complete the Block chapters (or O'Mahoney alternative)
- Read the Sturdy (2011) article
- Review at least two of the academic source summaries that interest you
- Note any questions about the content for the live session

Looking ahead to the full module, what are your development goals? Consider:
- **Skills**: Which consultancy skills do you most want to develop—contracting, diagnosis, stakeholder management, implementation?
- **Personal growth**: What aspects of working with influence (rather than authority) do you find most challenging?
- **Roles**: Which of the four consultant roles would you like to strengthen? Or, more generally, how do you want to show up as a consultant?
- What would "success" in this module look like for you professionally?

### Looking ahead

Next week, we begin working through the **consultancy cycle**: the stages of a typical consulting engagement from initial contact through to completion. Understanding this cycle will provide the structure for much of the rest of the module.

The stages we'll cover:
1. Entry and contracting
2. Discovery and diagnosis  
3. Analysis and solution development
4. Presentation and recommendations
5. Implementation support
6. Closure and evaluation

Week 1 has given you the context; the weeks ahead will develop the practical skills.

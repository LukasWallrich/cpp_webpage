Part 4: Why study consultancy critically? (~10 minutes)
- The dating platform problem: structural incentives in consulting
- Witch doctors, magicians, seducers: why performance matters
- Double agency and the lemons problem
- Creating uncertainty: threat of damnation, promise of salvation
- What the evidence actually shows about consulting impact
- Critical thinking as a professional skill, not cynicism

### Why a critical perspective?

Academic research on consultancy often takes a sceptical view. Consultants have been characterised as "witch doctors," "seducers," or promoters of management fads. Some of this is unfair; much of it is worth taking seriously.

A critical perspective doesn't mean cynicism. It means asking: Whose interests does this advice serve? What's the evidence base? What are the unintended consequences? These questions make you a better consultant and a better client of consultants.

### Multiple lenses on consultancy

Academic research examines consultancy from several interconnected perspectives:

:::framework
#### Four ways to study consultancy

**Consultancies as knowledge vehicles**
- Publishers of research and thought pieces
- Bridge the academic-practitioner divide (e.g., Tavistock Institute, McKinsey Global Institute)
- Create, promote and apply management knowledge

**Consultancies as organisations**
- Distinctive HR practices (e.g., "up-or-out" promotion systems)
- Experts in knowledge management
- Laboratories for organisational innovation

**Consultancy as a profession**
- Professional identity and codes of conduct
- But also professional *interests* to pursue
- A "precarious profession" with ambiguity about value and jurisdiction

**Consultancy as a practice/process**
- Knowledge creation and transfer with clients
- Consultant-client relationships and trust
- Factors affecting outcomes: success, failure, value for money

### Consultancy and uncertainty

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/sturdy_2013.pdf -->
:::source[sturdy2013]
Sturdy, Wylie, and Wright add a fourth dimension of uncertainty to the consultancy literature: **organisational uncertainty** (OU)—the fragile existence of consulting organisations and units themselves. Based on interviews with 93 individuals from 25 UK organisations, they examine internal consulting units (ICUs), five of which were disbanded during the study.

**Four sources of uncertainty in consultancy**:
- **Product**: Ambiguous outcomes make quality and added value difficult to assess
- **Relationship**: Outsider status creates trust issues and conflicting motives
- **Institutional**: Open boundaries and lack of professionalisation undermine confidence
- **Organisational** (new): Uncertainty over continued existence, given consulting is a *discretionary purchase*

**Three sources of organisational uncertainty for ICUs**:
| Source | Reduction strategy | Dilemma/risk |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Sponsor dependence ("who you know") | Relationship management to wider network | Raised expectations across competing clients |
| Matching expertise ("what you know") | Product/market diversification; up-skilling | Lose core business; fail to compete in new areas |
| Professional norms ("what you're willing to do") | Work prioritisation—saying "no" tactfully | Gain credibility but lose internal market |

**Key insight**: Consultancy is a "precarious profession" facing an ongoing requirement to justify its existence. Addressing one source of uncertainty often intensifies another—there is no stable solution.

### Principal-agent problems and information asymmetries

Consultancy highlights fundamental management challenges that affect the consultant-client relationship:

**Principal-agent issues** [@fincham2002]
- Managers act as agents of shareholders
- Consultants act as agents of managers
- This creates a double agency problem: difficult to incentivise consultants to achieve long-term success when their primary relationship is with managers, not shareholders

**Information asymmetries**
- Information asymmetry can lead to market failure—Akerlof's "lemons" problem [@akerlof1970]
- Clients struggle to assess consultant quality before engagement
- Reputation becomes crucial, though it's unclear whether reputation management actually creates value
- Consultants have agenda-setting power, potentially creating their own market demand

### Consultants as organisational actors

Academic research has characterised consultants through vivid metaphors that capture the performative and symbolic dimensions of consulting work:

- **Witch-doctors or Storytellers** [@clark1996]
- **Magicians** [@schuyt1998]
- **Seducers** [@sturdy1997]
- **Performers** [@clark1995]
- **Masters of ceremonies** [@thomassen2014]

These metaphors aren't (always) insults; they highlight that consultants exercise influence through symbolic performance, rhetoric, and relationship-building, not just technical expertise.

### Critical academic perspectives

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/clark_1996.pdf -->

Clark and Salaman argue that management **gurus** (rather than consultants specifically) function as modern organisational witchdoctors. Drawing on anthropological literature, they contend that a guru's work is fundamentally a *performance* aimed at transforming consciousness.

**Key arguments**:
- Guru performances achieve "transformations of consciousness"—they change how managers see themselves and their world (p. 87)
- Like witchdoctors, gurus use dramatic staging, symbolism, and rhetoric to establish authority and create emotional impact
- Success depends not on the objective validity of knowledge claims but on the *persuasiveness* of the performance
- Both witchdoctors and gurus operate in situations of uncertainty where outcomes cannot be easily verified

**Critical perspective**: The authors don't claim gurus are frauds, but that understanding their *dramaturgical* function reveals why some ideas spread regardless of evidence. The theatrical elements of management knowledge transfer are not incidental—they are central to how influence operates.

**Key insight**: "Guru performances achieve transformations of consciousness" (p. 87). Understanding consultancy requires attending to *how* knowledge is performed, not just *what* knowledge is claimed.

*This is one of your core readings.* Sturdy critically reviews evidence on whether management consultancy actually affects management practice and organisational outcomes.

**Key arguments**:
- Consultancy's impact is commonly **overstated**: studies claiming global reach often draw on geographically limited samples; consultants become convenient scapegoats for management failures
- But impact is also **understated**: internal consultancy is neglected in research; much "management" has effectively *become* consultancy (adopting its tools, techniques, and rhetorics)
- Direct causal evidence remains methodologically difficult—consultancy is co-produced with clients, making attribution hard
- The focus on external "Big Consultancy" obscures how consulting practices permeate organisations through internal functions and management education

**Methodology**: Critical literature review examining macro-level diffusion studies, organisational case studies, and theoretical perspectives on knowledge transfer.

**Key insight**: "We need to be more cautious about claims made of (and by) consultancy" (p. 527). The question is not simply "does consultancy work?" but rather how consulting practices reshape what management *is*.

Using Bruno Latour's **actor-network theory**, Collins examines how the Management Consultancies Association (MCA) in the UK constructs and legitimates "best practice" through its annual awards process, established in 1996.

**Key arguments**:
- The MCA has been written out of academic analyses despite playing a central role in legitimating consulting
- "Best practice" depends on mobilising an extended network: member firms submit standardised case studies; a "college of consulting" (the Durham Consulting Group) screens entries; a judging panel including government, media, and business representatives selects winners
- The DCG provides academic veneer but operates under MCA-defined ethics and criteria—not true academic independence
- Media partners (e.g., *Management Today*) then present winners to the public, obscuring the constructed nature of the awards

**Critical perspective**: The process creates "a world where best practice is natural, stable and uncontroversial; a public good; a beacon and a boon to all" (p. 29). This framing hides genuine debate about consulting effectiveness behind legitimising rituals.

**Key insight**: "Best practice" is not discovered but *constituted* through networks of allies, advocates, and spectators. Academic models of consulting that ignore trade bodies like the MCA miss crucial legitimation mechanisms.

A conceptual analysis using **memetics** (the study of how ideas replicate and spread) to explain why some management concepts become fashionable:

- **Interpersonal vs economic fitness**: Ideas spread not because they're effective, but because they're *contagious*—easy to communicate and transfer between people. "The memes that survive and get disseminated are those most likely to reproduce themselves" regardless of actual value
- **Consultants within institutional constraints**: Knowledge entrepreneurs craft ideas to maximise transferability, but they "do not do this in isolation... they act within an institutional context subject to constraints"
- **Managers as active filters**: Clients aren't passive victims; they select ideas that fit their existing beliefs and institutional context. Ideas must "resonate with 'norms' or meta-memes" to succeed
- **Influence tactics**: Consultants shape demand by destabilising audiences, using metaphors to manage meaning, and "identifying problems by presenting solutions"

**Key insight**: "The consultant-client relationship is more complex than 'tricksters duping victims'... managers are not absolved of all responsibility for fashions and fads" (p. 778). Both parties contribute to the fashion cycle.

Which of these critical perspectives resonates most with your experience? Have you observed consultants using symbolic performance, creating uncertainty, or promoting "best practices" that may not be evidence-based? How can you apply these insights to become a more thoughtful practitioner?

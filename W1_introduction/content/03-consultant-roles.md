These roles aren't fixed; effective consultants move between them as needed. But it's crucial to know which role you're in at any moment, and whether the client shares that understanding.

Look at the four roles above. Which feels most natural to you? Which would you like to develop? Where does your current work sit on the "consultancy continuum" from informal advice-giving to formal external consultancy?

### Internal vs external consultants

Block [-@block2011] argues that internal consultants face the same challenges as externals, but with *more intensity*: embedded in hierarchy and politics, needing to satisfy their own boss while serving internal clients, often operating by mandate rather than choice. This breeds caution, and caution in turn breeds "pair of hands" usage rather than strategic partnership.

Yet internal consultants also have advantages: organisational knowledge, established relationships, and ongoing accountability for outcomes.

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/wright_2009.pdf -->
:::source[wright2009]
Based on interviews with 30 HR and OD managers from 24 Australian organisations, Wright examines how internal consultants construct their work identities. Internal consultants are "outsiders within"—permanent employees who nevertheless operate outside traditional hierarchies and authority structures.

**Four boundary dimensions** shape internal consultants' identity work:

| Boundary | Preferred identity | Spoiled identity |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Structural | Change agent, boundary-spanner, trusted adviser | Administrator, "fix-it person", "HR go to" |
| Knowledge | Esoteric expert, professional | Impractical, service provider |
| Political | Player, jester/organisational conscience | Outsider, functionary |
| Interpersonal | Colleague, confidant | Loner, outcast |

**Key arguments**:
- Internal consultants seek to balance *distinctiveness* (structural and knowledge boundaries) with *inclusion* (political and interpersonal boundaries)
- This ambivalence can be "a positive source of strength and distinctiveness" (p. 319), not merely a problem to resolve
- However, achieving a preferred identity requires others to grant these claims—it is not unilateral
- Over time, distinctive expertise may decay as consultants become "part of the furniture" (p. 320)

**Key insight**: "Organizational membership is less a matter of being in or out than knowing when and to what degree one is a member" (citing Bartel & Dutton, 2001). Success depends on actively managing identity tensions across all four boundaries.

### Why organisations employ consultants (and what they really want)

Ringland and Shaukat [-@ringland2004] identify five reasons organisations hire consultants: implementation support, specialist knowledge, independence/impartiality, validation/assurance, and blame management.

![Diagram showing five key reasons organisations employ management consultants (based on Ringland and Shaukat 2004). Three reasons shown in green represent legitimate needs: Implementation (client resources constrained, need efficient horsepower), Specialist knowledge (industry-specific, organisation-specific, issue-specific such as M&A), and Independence/Impartiality (objectivity, distance from corporate politics). Two reasons shown in amber and red represent more problematic motivations: Validation/assurance (rubber-stamping internal work, making client look good) and Blame (where internal work goes wrong, where stakeholders need a scapegoat).](content/img/3-reasons.png)

The critical insight here is that the **stated reason** for bringing in consultants may differ from the **actual reason**. A project described as needing "specialist knowledge" might actually be about "validation"—lending external credibility to a decision already made. An engagement framed as "independence" might really be about having someone to blame if things go wrong.

This creates ethical tensions. If a client wants uncritical validation rather than genuine analysis, do you provide what's requested or what's needed? Professional consulting values emphasise honest, evidence-based advice—but clients sometimes want reassurance, not challenge.

Navigating this requires understanding what's really being asked of you whilst maintaining professional integrity. The most effective consultants learn to surface these unspoken expectations early, often in the contracting phase, rather than discovering them when presenting findings the client doesn't want to hear.

:::reflect
Think of a challenging consultancy project you have been involved with—as client or consultant. What were the stated reasons for the engagement? What do you think were the actual motivations?

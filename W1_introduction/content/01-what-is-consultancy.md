Part 1: Defining consultancy (~8 minutes)
- Block's definition: influence without direct control
- Taylor's origin story: the shovel experiments at Bethlehem Steel (1898)
- The trap consultancy still falls into: brilliant analysis, poor implementation
- Why getting people to act on advice matters as much as the advice itself

:::definition
"You are consulting every time you are trying to change or improve a situation but have no direct control over the implementation."
Peter Block, *Flawless Consulting* (1999)
:::


Block's definition is deliberately broad. It captures not just external consultants, but also internal advisors, HR business partners, and anyone whose job involves influencing decisions they won't personally implement. That breadth is intentional: the skills and challenges are surprisingly similar.

Industry bodies define management consultancy more narrowly:

"Management consultancy creates value for organisations and the wider economy through improved performance, achieved by providing objective advice and implementing business solutions."
Management Consultancies Association (MCA)

### A brief history

Modern consultancy traces to Frederick Taylor's "scientific management" in the early 1900s: the systematic study of work to increase efficiency. The industry professionalised through firms like McKinsey (1926), which began hiring MBA graduates and positioning consultants as professionals comparable to doctors or lawyers. Regulation also played a role: the US Securities Act of 1933 required investment banks to commission independent financial research, creating an early market for external advisory services.

Key developments since then: 

- accountancy firms built consultancy arms in the 1980s (the Big Four),
- IT transformations and technology adoptions created new markets,
- expertise became increasingly valued, leading to recruiting from beyond the traditional generalised MBA pool.

### Further reading on origins

This chapter traces the engineering origins of management consulting, challenging the myth that 'modern' consulting began solely with strategy advisers like McKinsey. Wright and Kipping demonstrate that efficiency engineers were the first true management consultants and dominated the global industry until the 1960s.

**Key findings**:
- Frederick Taylor's direct impact on diffusing scientific management was limited; it was consulting firms like Emerson (founded 1907) and Bedaux (founded 1916) that acted as 'carrying organisations' for the widespread application of these ideas across industries and nations
- The distinction between 'efficiency engineers' and 'modern' strategy consultants is a historical construction; even McKinsey's 1957 brochure listed operational efficiency services, and efficiency-based firms like Maynard and George S. May were the largest global consultancies well into the 1960s
- Bedaux's firm became the first truly global consultancy, with over 1,000 client plants by the late 1930s and offices spanning the US, Western Europe, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Africa, and Australia
- The legacy of efficiency consulting persists in contemporary practices such as quality management, lean production, Six Sigma, and business process re-engineering (BPR), with operations management still contributing an estimated 25% of global consulting revenues

**Key insight**: The first management consultants were efficiency engineers, and understanding consulting's industrial engineering origins reveals that much of what we consider 'modern' consulting practice has deeper roots in shop-floor operational improvement than boardroom strategy.

### The full consultancy cycle

Many consultancy firms emphasise their problem-solving capabilities. McKinsey, for instance, has developed a well-known [seven-step problem-solving process](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-to-master-the-seven-step-problem-solving-process) that has become influential across the industry:

![Flowchart showing McKinsey's seven-step problem-solving process: starting from Client problem, the steps flow through Define problem, Structure problem, Prioritize issues, Plan analyses and work, Conduct analyses, Synthesize findings, and Develop recommendation. Two parallel streams run throughout - Problem-solving focus above and Communications below - with guiding questions at each step such as 'Think impact: What does the client need to know?' and 'Think so what: What implications do our findings have for the client?'](content/img/1-mckinsey_problem_solving.jpg)

This structured approach to analysis and recommendation development is valuable. However, focusing solely on problem-solving represents only half of what consultants actually do. Hodges [-@hodges2017] presents a more complete picture with the **consultancy cycle**:

![Circular diagram of the Consulting Cycle (Hodges 2017) showing seven stages arranged clockwise: Initial contact, Contracting, Diagnosis and Analysis, Intervention, Implementation, Evaluation, and Transition. The right side (Initial contact through Intervention) is labelled Problem-Solving Focus in purple; the left side (Implementation through Transition) is labelled Implementation Focus in blue.](content/img/1-consultancy-cycle.png)

The cycle shows that consultancy work involves two equally important halves:

- **Problem-solving focus** (right side): Initial contact, contracting, diagnosis and analysis, and intervention design
- **Implementation focus** (left side): Implementation, evaluation, and transition back to business-as-usual

Many consultancy engagements fail not because of poor analysis, but because of inadequate attention to implementation. The consultant who delivers a brilliant report but pays little attention to how recommendations will be enacted, who will champion them, and what resistance might emerge is only doing half the job. This is why we'll spend considerable time in this module on stakeholder management, change management, and implementation planning—not just analytical frameworks.

Think about a time you tried to influence a decision or change at work without having direct authority to implement it. What made that challenging? What helped?

## Overview

This week introduces the field of management consultancy: what it is, how the industry developed, and the different ways consultants and clients work together. We'll also begin to explore academic perspectives that will help you think critically about consultancy practice throughout the module.

:::outcomes
- Define consultancy and distinguish it from other forms of professional work
- Describe the structure and major players in the global consultancy industry
- Explain different roles consultants can play and reasons why they are engaged by clients
- Articulate why a "critical perspective" on consultancy matters for practitioners
- State your own development goals for this module

### How to use these materials

To prepare for the live session, you should:

1. **Watch the recordings** for each section (Parts 1-4, ~60 minutes total), and skim the written content that highlights key points
2. **Complete the core readings**: Block (2011) Chapters 1-2 and Sturdy (2011)
3. **Work through the preparation checklist** at the end

The expandable academic source summaries throughout these materials are **optional enrichment**. They provide deeper context if you're interested, but aren't essential for the live session. Try to find some time to extend your learning, but don't worry if you can't get through everything.

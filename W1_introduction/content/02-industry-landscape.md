### Industry structure

The global consulting market is estimated at ~$300 billion (2024). It's useful to think of three tiers:

*Plus:* thousands of boutique and specialist firms, freelance consultants, and internal consultancy functions.

### Geographic and market concentration

Consultancy spend is highly concentrated: 70% of global fees come from just five countries (USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada). This reflects both economic weight and cultural factors; some business cultures are more receptive to external advice than others.

This article develops a framework explaining why management consultancy usage varies dramatically across nations, challenging the assumption that consultants are universally the primary source of external management knowledge. Using Japan as an illustrative case, the authors demonstrate how economic, cultural, state, organisational and educational factors combine to shape both demand for and supply of consulting services.

**Key findings**:
- Consultancy use is heavily concentrated: 70% of global consulting fees are generated in just five nations (USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France), far exceeding their 33% share of global GDP
- Five interconnected drivers explain national variation: the economy, the state, culture and ideology, organisations and their relationships, and education systems
- Alternative knowledge sources (industry associations, government-sponsored institutes, internal company transfers) can substitute for consultants, as demonstrated in Japan and Germany
- Cultural factors such as collectivism versus individualism significantly affect receptiveness to external advisors, with collectivist cultures often viewing outside knowledge as less legitimate

**Key insight**: The dominance of management consultancy is not a universal phenomenon but a distinctly Anglo-American pattern shaped by specific institutional, cultural and economic conditions that other nations may not share.

### Current disruption

Academic researchers [@christensen2013] predicted that consulting was "on the cusp of disruption" as information asymmetry eroded. That prediction is now materialising, accelerated by AI.

In December 2025, McKinsey announced plans to cut ~10% of its workforce over 18-24 months, reflecting both demand slowdown and automation of junior analyst tasks. The traditional "pyramid model" (many juniors, few partners) is under direct pressure.

The industry also faces increasing public scrutiny. Recent high-profile scandals have included McKinsey's $650 million settlement over its role in the US opioid crisis, PwC's Australian tax leak scandal, and Deloitte consultants caught billing for (poor) AI-generated work. This raises questions about ethics and accountability in an industry with no mandatory professional regulation.

A former McKinsey director argues that the firm's layoffs signal an irreversible shift in how value is created in consulting, as AI commoditises the analytical capabilities that traditionally justified premium fees. The article contends that consulting's centre of gravity is moving from pure strategy towards integrated execution, favouring firms with strong technology and implementation DNA.

**Key findings**:
- AI is equalising analytical and recommendation capabilities, commoditising the "first-principles problem-solving" that built McKinsey's competitive moat
- Implementation-led firms (Accenture, Deloitte, EY) have grown at approximately 11-12% annually, outpacing strategy-focused MBB firms at 5-6%, reflecting where client spend is shifting
- Strategic advantage is shifting from problem-solving to sense-making—"from humans 'in the loop' to humans 'above the loop'"
- The firms best positioned to win are either execution-focused consultancies with strong technology foundations, or industry specialists with exceptional domain expertise

**Key insight**: In the AI age, even the most storied consulting institutions must continuously reinvent themselves—moving from authority rooted in expertise to leadership grounded in learning and adaptability—or risk being outpaced by those that do.

Christensen and colleagues apply disruption theory to the consulting industry, arguing that the same forces that transformed steel and publishing are now reshaping professional services. The article examines how consulting's traditional defences—opacity and agility—are eroding as clients become more sophisticated and new competitors emerge with alternative business models.

**Key findings**:
- The consulting industry is shifting from integrated "solution shops" (like McKinsey and BCG) towards modular providers and facilitated networks that offer specialised services at lower cost—classic strategy work has declined from 60-70% to about 20% of traditional firms' portfolios
- Two forces historically protected consulting from disruption: opacity (difficulty measuring consultant performance) and agility (ability to pivot quickly between ideas), but both are rapidly diminishing as clients hire former consultants internally and gain access to democratised knowledge through data providers
- Technology-enabled "asset-based consulting" and big data analytics are automating routine analytical work, whilst alternative firms like Eden McCallum assemble experienced freelance consultants at a fraction of traditional costs
- Incumbent firms face the classic innovator's dilemma: their existing resources, processes, and priorities become "sea anchors" when attempting to change course

**Key insight**: "There may be nothing as vulnerable as entrenched success"—consulting firms that dismiss disruption because their current model has worked well are exhibiting precisely the complacency that has preceded the downfall of incumbents in every other disrupted industry.

**Assessment in hindsight**: The direction was correct; the timeline was slower than implied until generative AI arrived. The piece is worth reading both for its analysis and as an example of applying disruption theory to professional services.

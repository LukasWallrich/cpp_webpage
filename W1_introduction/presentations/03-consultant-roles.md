# Recording 3: The Roles Consultants Play

**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Slides:** 5
**Core message:** Four roles you'll move between—know which one you're in, and make sure your client agrees.

## Slide 1: Title
**Visual:** Title slide

**Talking points:**
- Brief recording—but crucial concepts
- Not all consulting looks the same
- Understanding roles helps you navigate expectations

## Slide 2: Four Consultant Archetypes
**Visual:** 2x2 grid with icons and descriptions

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔧 **Plumber** | Expert pair-of-hands. Solve a defined problem with specialist skills. |
| 🩺 **Doctor** | Diagnose the issue, prescribe a solution. Client trusts your expertise. |
| 🧭 **Advisor** | Strategic partner. Support client's own problem-solving; they retain ownership. |
| 🗺️ **Navigator** | Guide through change. Focus on implementation and stakeholder management. |

**Talking points:**
- Four archetypes, adapted from Schein's work
- **Plumber**: Problem is defined, you fix it. Technical expertise.
- **Doctor**: You diagnose what's wrong and prescribe. Client defers to your judgement.
- **Advisor**: You help them think through options; they decide. Partnership model.
- **Navigator**: You guide them through implementing a decision. Change management.

## Slide 3: Flexibility Is Key
**Visual:** Circular diagram showing movement between roles

**Talking points:**
- These aren't fixed identities—you'll shift within a single engagement
- Start as Doctor (diagnosis), become Navigator (implementation)
- Or: client asks for Plumber, actually needs Advisor
- Critical skill: knowing which role you're in at any moment
- Danger: misalignment with client expectations
- Best practice: discuss roles explicitly during contracting

## Slide 4: Internal vs External Consultants
**Visual:** Two-column comparison

| Internal Consultants | External Consultants |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| + Organisational knowledge | + Fresh perspective |
| + Established relationships | + Perceived independence |
| + Ongoing accountability | + Easier to challenge |
| − Embedded in politics | − Learning curve on context |
| − Often by mandate not choice | − May exit before impact clear |
| − May breed caution | − Trust must be built quickly |

**Talking points:**
- Block: internals face same challenges, but with more intensity
- Embedded in hierarchy—boss to satisfy plus client to serve
- Often assigned rather than chosen—neither party fully committed
- Risk of honest feedback—they're stuck with consequences
- This breeds caution → "pair of hands" usage over time
- But also: deep knowledge, ongoing relationships, accountability

## Slide 5: Internal Consultant Identity (Wright 2009)
**Visual:** Table of preferred vs spoiled identities

| Boundary | Preferred identity | Spoiled identity |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Structural | Change agent, trusted adviser | Administrator, "fix-it person" |
| Knowledge | Expert, professional | Service provider, impractical |
| Political | Player, organisational conscience | Outsider, functionary |
| Interpersonal | Colleague, confidant | Loner, outcast |

**Talking points:**
- Wright's research: internal consultants actively manage how they're perceived
- Tension between how they want to be seen and how they fear being seen
- Key insight: ambiguity can be strength or vulnerability
- Claim both specialist expertise AND intimate organisational knowledge
- Or: dismissed as impractical theorist OR too embedded to be objective
- Success = actively managing these identity tensions
- Reflection: which role feels natural? Which would you like to develop?

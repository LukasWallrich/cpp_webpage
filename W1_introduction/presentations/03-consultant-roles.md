## Slide 1: Opening Story

**Visual:** M&A or due diligence imagery

**[Presenter's personal story]:**
Set up from your experience on M&A due diligence teams—the ambiguity about what the client actually wants from you. Are you there to give an honest assessment? To validate a decision that's already been made? To provide cover if things go wrong?

The brief rarely says. And asking directly can feel awkward.

This recording is about learning to read what's actually being asked—and why that matters for how you do the work.

## Slide 2: Four Roles

**Visual:** 2x2 grid with icons: Plumber, Doctor, Advisor, Navigator

**Talking points:**

- **Plumber**: Fix the defined problem. They know what's broken; you have the skills.
- **Doctor**: Diagnose what's wrong. They trust your expertise to identify the issue.
- **Advisor**: Help them think. You support their problem-solving; they own the decision.
- **Navigator**: Guide through change. The decision is made; you help make it happen.

**Key point:**
You'll move between these in a single engagement. The skill is noticing when the role shifts—and when there's a mismatch between what they're asking for and what they actually need.

## Slide 3: Why They Hire You

**Visual:** Five reasons (green/amber/red traffic light)

**Talking points:**

Three straightforward reasons:
- **Capacity**: They need more hands
- **Expertise**: They need specialist knowledge
- **Independence**: They need an outside perspective

Two trickier ones:
- **Validation**: They've already decided; they want external credibility
- **Blame**: If it goes wrong, they need someone to point at

**Key insight:**
The stated reason often differs from the actual reason. "We need an independent review" sometimes means "we need someone credible to agree with us." Understanding this isn't cynicism—it's professional awareness.

## Slide 4: Surfacing the Hidden Brief

**Visual:** Three key questions

**Story to tell:**
The best consultants have conversations during contracting that surface what's really being asked. Not confrontationally, but curiously.

*"What would success look like?"*—if they describe a specific outcome, they may want validation rather than open analysis.

*"Who else has looked at this?"*—if there have been internal debates, you may be a tiebreaker or a scapegoat.

*"What happens if my findings surprise you?"*—this tests whether they're genuinely open to diagnosis.

These conversations are uncomfortable. But having them early prevents worse discomfort later.

## Slide 5: Internal Consultants

**Visual:** Brief comparison or key tension

**Talking points:**

Same dynamics apply to internal consultants—HR partners, change teams, internal strategy. But with higher stakes: you can't walk away, the client is also a colleague, and your reputation follows you.

Research by Wright found internal consultants constantly managing how they're perceived. They want to be trusted advisers; they fear being seen as administrators or "fix-it people."

The same role-and-reason questions matter. But the politics make them harder to ask.

## Slide 6: Your Reflection

**Visual:** Question prompt

> Think about a consulting engagement you've experienced. What role were you asked to play? What role did they actually need? Did the stated reason match the real motivation?

**Bridge:**
The written materials detail the four roles and Wright's research on internal consultant identity.

Final recording: why academic researchers are often sceptical about consultancy—and why that scepticism makes you better at the job.

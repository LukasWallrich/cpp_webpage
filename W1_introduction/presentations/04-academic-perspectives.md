## Slide 1: Title
**Visual:** Title slide

**Talking points:**
- Final recording for Week 1
- Different from practical skills—this is about how we think about consultancy
- Academic perspectives: sometimes sceptical, always illuminating

---

## Slide 2: Why a Critical Perspective?
**Visual:** Key questions displayed

> Whose interests does this advice serve?
> What's the evidence base?
> What are the unintended consequences?

**Talking points:**
- Academics often sceptical of consultancy
- Some criticism unfair; much worth taking seriously
- Critical ≠ cynical
- These questions make you better at the job
- Whether you're a consultant or a client of consultants

## Slide 3: Four Lenses on Consultancy
**Visual:** Four quadrants or boxes

| Lens | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Knowledge vehicles** | Creating, promoting, applying management ideas |
| **Organisations** | How consultancies themselves work (up-or-out, knowledge management) |
| **Profession** | Identity, codes of conduct, legitimacy struggles |
| **Practice/process** | What actually happens in engagements; outcomes |

**Talking points:**
- Multiple valid ways to study consultancy
- Each reveals different insights
- Knowledge: consultancies as publishers, thought leaders
- Organisations: distinctive HR practices, knowledge management
- Profession: precarious status, no clear jurisdiction
- Practice: what drives success, failure, value for money

## Slide 4: The "Witch Doctors" Debate
**Visual:** Metaphor list or word cloud

> Witch-doctors (Clark & Salaman) • Magicians (Schuyt & Schuijt) • Seducers (Sturdy) • Performers (Clark) • Masters of ceremonies (Thomassen)

**Talking points:**
- Vivid metaphors from academic research
- Not just insults—highlight something real
- Consultants exercise influence through symbolic performance, not just technical expertise
- Specialised language, rituals (workshops, frameworks), mystique
- Clark & Salaman: providing "symbolic reassurance" rather than proven solutions
- Important implication: HOW you communicate matters as much as WHAT you say

## Slide 5: Consultancy and Uncertainty
**Visual:** Three sources of uncertainty diagram

**Talking points:**
- Uncertainty central to management—and to consultancy
- Consultants brought in to handle uncertainty—but may also intensify it
- **Product uncertainty**: Hard to assess quality of advice, especially when co-produced
- **Relationship uncertainty**: Outsider status, potential conflicting motives
- **Institutional uncertainty**: No clear professional jurisdiction; industry resists independent regulation
- Result: "precarious profession" constantly justifying its existence

---

## Slide 6: Principal-Agent Problems
**Visual:** Chain diagram: Shareholders → Managers → Consultants

**Talking points:**
- Classic management challenge: principal-agent problem
- Shareholders (principals) hire managers (agents)—but interests may diverge
- Now add consultants: agents of managers, not shareholders
- Double agency problem
- Hard to incentivise long-term success when relationship is with manager
- Manager may want validation, not truth; consultant may want repeat business
- Whose interests does the advice really serve?

---

## Slide 7: Information Asymmetries
**Visual:** Key concepts highlighted

**Talking points:**
- Akerlof's "lemons" problem (1970): when buyers can't assess quality, markets can fail
- Clients struggle to judge consultant quality before (or even after) engagement
- Reputation becomes crucial—but what does reputation actually signal?
- Consultants also have agenda-setting power
- Can define problems in ways that require their solutions
- "Identifying problems by presenting solutions"

## Slide 8: FUD-ding—Creating Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt
**Visual:** FUD acronym with bullet points

**Talking points:**
- Randall et al.: consultancies may promote uncertainty to make themselves indispensable
- Tactics:
  - Challenge norms and worldviews (create disequilibrium)
  - Reframe familiar ideas
  - Threaten "damnation" but offer "salvation"
- Critical question: is this manipulation or necessary challenge?
- Sometimes clients NEED their assumptions challenged
- But same tactics can serve consultant interests over client interests
- Distinguish the framing from the actual actions

---

## Slide 9: What Does the Evidence Actually Show?
**Visual:** Sturdy (2011) key findings

**Talking points:**
- Sturdy's review: direct evidence of consulting impact is surprisingly thin
- Methodologically hard to study—what's the counterfactual?
- What we do know:
  - Consultancy clearly affects management discourse (how people talk and think)
  - Impact varies hugely by context, client capability, engagement type
  - Relationship often matters more than content of advice
- Not an attack on consulting—a call for clearer thinking
- Don't oversell; be honest about what you can and can't demonstrate

## Slide 10: So What?
**Visual:** Summary takeaway

> Critical thinking makes you better—at consulting AND at hiring consultants.

**Talking points:**
- Apply same rigour to your own practice
- Apply it to the industry's claims about itself
- "Best practice" is often rhetorical construction, not neutral description
- Ask: whose interests? what evidence? what consequences?
- This module will help you develop both practical skills AND critical judgement
- Preview: readings for this week—Block and Sturdy
- Come to the live session ready to discuss what surprised you

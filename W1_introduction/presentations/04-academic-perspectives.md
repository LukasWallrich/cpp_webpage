**Duration:** ~10 minutes

**Core message:** Critical thinking doesn't mean cynicism—it makes you better at the job.

## Slide 1: The Dating Platform Problem

**Visual:** Simple analogy setup

**Story to tell:**
Here's a question about incentives.

A dating platform makes money while you're looking for a partner. If you find one too quickly, you cancel your subscription. So what's the platform actually optimised for?

Now apply that logic to consulting.

A consultant's revenue depends on ongoing engagements. If you solve the problem too quickly, the project ends. If you build the client's capability too well, they won't need you next time.

This isn't about bad people. It's about structural incentives. And understanding them is part of being a thoughtful professional—whether you're a consultant or hiring one.

## Slide 2: The Witch Doctors

**Visual:** List of metaphors: Witch-doctors, Magicians, Seducers, Performers, Masters of ceremonies

**Story to tell:**
Academic researchers have used some vivid language to describe consultants. Witch doctors. Magicians. Seducers.

These aren't just insults. They're pointing at something real.

Consultants don't succeed purely on technical expertise. They succeed through *performance*—how they present, how they build credibility, how they make clients feel confident in their recommendations.

**Key insight:**
This isn't necessarily bad. Clients facing uncertainty need confidence as well as analysis. But it does mean *how* you communicate matters as much as *what* you recommend. And the same techniques that build legitimate confidence can also sell weak ideas convincingly.

## Slide 3: Double Agency

**Visual:** Chain diagram: Shareholders → Managers → Consultants

**Story to tell:**
There's a classic problem in management: the principal-agent problem. Shareholders hire managers, but managers have their own interests—career, comfort, ego.

Now add consultants. Consultants are hired by managers, not shareholders. So we have a *double* agency problem.

The consultant's client is the manager. If the manager wants validation rather than truth, the consultant who provides truth might not get the next engagement. If the manager wants to avoid blame, the consultant becomes the scapegoat.

**The question:**
Whose interests does the advice actually serve? The organisation's? The manager's? The consultant's? They're not always aligned.

## Slide 4: The Lemons Problem

**Visual:** Key concept: Information asymmetry

**Story to tell:**
There's a famous economics paper about used cars. When buyers can't assess quality, bad products drive out good ones—because sellers of good products can't prove their quality is worth the price.

Consulting has a similar problem. Before you hire a consultant, how do you know they're good? During the engagement, how do you know their advice is sound? Even after, how do you know the outcome was because of them?

This is why reputation matters so much in consulting—it's one of the few signals available. But reputation can be gamed. And it creates a market where confident performance may matter more than actual effectiveness.

## Slide 5: Creating Uncertainty

**Visual:** FUD—Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt

**Story to tell:**
Back to the dating platform problem.

If consultants benefit from ongoing uncertainty, some might—consciously or not—create it.

The tactics have been documented: Challenge the client's worldview. Reframe familiar problems as crises. Paint vivid pictures of what happens if they don't act.

Huczynski (1993) called it "the threat of damnation and the promise of salvation."

**The honest question:**
Sometimes clients genuinely need their assumptions disrupted. The same techniques that create unnecessary anxiety can shake complacent organisations into necessary action.

The difference is whether the disruption serves the client or the consultant. And that's hard for even well-intentioned consultants to judge about themselves.

## Slide 6: What Does the Evidence Show?

**Visual:** Key finding from Sturdy (2011)

**Story to tell:**
Andrew Sturdy reviewed the evidence on consulting impact. His conclusion: surprisingly thin.

Not because consulting doesn't work—but because it's genuinely hard to study. What's the counterfactual? How do you separate the consultant's contribution from everything else?

What we do know:
- Consulting shapes how managers think and talk—the frameworks, the language
- Impact varies hugely by context and client capability
- The relationship often matters more than the content of advice

**What this means:**
Don't oversell. Be honest about what you can and can't demonstrate.

## Slide 7: So What?

**Visual:** Three questions

**Story to tell:**
Critical thinking isn't cynicism. It's asking better questions.

*Whose interests does this advice serve?*—Including your own.

*What's the evidence base?*—For your recommendations, and for the frameworks you're using.

*What are the unintended consequences?*—Of what you're recommending, and of how you're framing it.

These questions make you a better consultant. They also make you a better client—able to distinguish genuine expertise from confident performance.

**Reflection:**
Come to the live session having read Block and Sturdy. What surprised you? What resonated with your experience?

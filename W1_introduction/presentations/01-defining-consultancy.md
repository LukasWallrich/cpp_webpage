# Recording 1: Defining Consultancy

**Duration:** ~8 minutes
**Slides:** 7-8
**Core message:** Consultancy is influence without direct control—a definition that applies far beyond external consultants.

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Visual:** Title slide with week/topic

**Talking points:**
- Welcome to Week 1
- Today: what consultancy actually is, and why the definition matters

---

## Slide 2: Block's Definition
**Visual:** Quote prominently displayed with Block's photo

> "You are consulting every time you are trying to change or improve a situation but have no direct control over the implementation."
> — Peter Block, *Flawless Consulting* (1999)

**Talking points:**
- This is our working definition for the module
- Key phrase: "no direct control"
- If you can just order it done, you're managing; the moment you need to persuade, you're consulting

---

## Slide 3: Why This Definition Matters
**Visual:** Venn diagram or overlapping circles showing: External consultants, Internal advisors, HR partners, Managers-as-coaches

**Talking points:**
- Deliberately broad definition
- Captures anyone who advises without implementing
- You've probably been a consultant without knowing it
- The skills transfer across all these contexts

---

## Slide 4: The MCA's Industry Definition
**Visual:** MCA definition as quote block

> "Management consultancy creates value for organisations and the wider economy through improved performance, achieved by providing objective advice and implementing business solutions."

**Talking points:**
- Industry bodies define it more narrowly
- Note the emphasis on "value creation" and "objective advice"
- Also includes implementation—not just advice
- We'll use both definitions: Block for the practice, MCA for the industry

## Slide 5: Origins—Taylor and Scientific Management
**Visual:** Photo of Frederick Taylor + factory/industrial imagery

**Talking points:**
- 1880s-1910s: Frederick Taylor's "scientific management"
- Radical idea: work processes can be systematically studied and optimised
- First time outsiders analysed how work should be done
- Famous example: Bethlehem Steel—optimal shovel weight (~21 pounds)
- Start of management as a profession separate from apprenticeship

---

## Slide 6: The Industry Takes Shape
**Visual:** Timeline: 1886 Arthur D Little → 1926 McKinsey → 1933 Securities Act → 1980s Big 4

**Talking points:**
- 1886: Arthur D Little—first management consultancy (MIT professor)
- 1926: McKinsey founded; Marvin Bower positioned consultants as professionals (like doctors, lawyers)
- 1933: US Securities Act required independent financial research—created regulatory demand
- 1980s: Big 4 accountancies built consulting arms
- Key shift: from industry experts to MBA generalists, then back toward expertise

---

## Slide 7: Problem-Solving and Implementation
**Visual:** McKinsey 7-step process diagram OR consultancy cycle diagram

**Talking points:**
- Consultancy involves two halves: diagnosis/recommendation AND implementation support
- McKinsey's 7-step process focuses on the analytical side
- But many engagements fail not because of poor analysis—because of poor implementation
- Einstein (attributed): "55 minutes defining the problem, 5 minutes solving it"
- We'll cover both halves in this module

## Slide 8: Reflection
**Visual:** Question prompt

> Think about a time you tried to influence a decision or change at work without having direct authority. What made it challenging? What helped?

**Talking points:**
- Personal connection—they've all experienced this
- Preview: the module will help develop these skills systematically
- Next recording: the industry landscape

# Recording 1: Defining Consultancy

**Duration:** ~8 minutes
**Slides:** 5-6
**Core message:** Consultancy is influence without control—and it started with a shovel.

## Slide 1: The Question

**Visual:** Simple question on screen

> When are you *not* a consultant?

**Story to tell:**
Think about your work week. Meetings where you're advising on things you won't implement. Emails where you're recommending changes you can't mandate. Presentations where you're trying to shift thinking in a room where you have no formal authority.

How much of your work is actually consultancy—even if no one calls it that?

## Slide 2: Block's Definition

**Visual:** Quote prominently displayed

> "You are consulting every time you are trying to change or improve a situation but have no direct control over the implementation."
> — Peter Block

**Key insight:**
The moment you need to persuade rather than order—you're consulting. This reframes your job. It's not just what you advise, but how you get people to act on that advice. That's what this module is about.

## Slide 3: A Man and His Shovel

**Visual:** Historical photo of Bethlehem Steel or industrial workers (1900s)

**Story to tell:**
Spring 1898. Frederick Winslow Taylor arrives at Bethlehem Steel in Pennsylvania. He's 42, a mechanical engineer from a wealthy Philadelphia family—but one who'd worked his way up from machinist's apprentice after failing eyesight forced him to abandon his place at Harvard. He'd spent years at Midvale Steel, rising from shop floor labourer to chief engineer, obsessed with one question: why is so much work done so badly?

Now he's a "consulting engineer"—his business card reads "Systematizing Shop Management and Manufacturing Costs a Specialty"—and Bethlehem has hired him to solve a capacity crisis. They're making cannons for the Spanish-American War and can't keep up.

Taylor looks at the yard. Some 500 men are shovelling coal and iron ore—same work their fathers did. Each man brings his own shovel. Shovelling dense iron ore, a load might weigh 30 pounds. Shovelling light rice coal, the same shovel holds barely 4 pounds. Nobody has ever asked: what's the right amount?

Taylor measures. He experiments. He discovers the sweet spot: 21 pounds. Too light, you waste motion. Too heavy, you exhaust yourself. He designs eight to ten different shovels for different materials. Coal gets a wide scoop. Iron ore gets a smaller one. Workers are issued the right shovel each morning.

Result? About 140 workers now do what 500 did before. Daily output per man jumps from 16 tons to nearly 60. And those who remain earn more, because they're more productive.

**Why this matters:**
This is one origin story of consultancy. A radical idea: *work itself can be studied and improved*. Not by the people doing it, but by someone standing back and analysing it.

Every consultant since is doing some version of what Taylor did—looking at how work happens and asking: could it be different?

## Slide 4: The Catch

**Visual:** Split image—beautiful report on one side, dusty shelf on the other

**Story to tell:**
Taylor's shovels worked—or did they? The analysis was elegant, and his 1911 book *The Principles of Scientific Management* made him famous. But here's what Taylor didn't solve: the workers weren't consulted. They resisted. Some were fired. Unions formed in response to his methods. And in 1901, just three years after arriving, Taylor was forced out of Bethlehem Steel after clashing with other managers.

There's a scholarly footnote here too: historians have questioned whether Taylor's dramatic numbers were entirely accurate. He may have embellished some results in later retellings. The truth was messier than the legend—which is itself a lesson about consultancy.

This is the trap consultancy still falls into: brilliant analysis, poor implementation. Ask anyone who's worked with consultants—or been one—and they'll tell you about beautifully argued recommendations that went nowhere because no one worked out how to make them stick.

**Key insight:**
Good consultancy is two halves: figuring out the answer AND helping people act on it. We'll work on both in this module.

## Slide 5: Your Reflection

**Visual:** Question prompt

> Think about a time you tried to change something at work without having direct authority. What made it hard? What helped?

**Bridge:**
Bring that experience to the live session. Everyone's been a consultant without realising it. The question is whether you were any good at it—and how you could be better.

Next recording: the industry that turned Taylor's insight into a $300 billion business.

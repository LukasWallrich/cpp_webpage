# Recording 2: The Consulting Industry Today

**Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Slides:** 6-7
**Core message:** A $300bn industry that's more fragmented than it looks—and facing its biggest disruption in decades.

## Slide 1: What Does $300 Billion Look Like?

**Visual:** Pyramid showing 2% large firms, 5% mid-size, 8% small, 85% freelancers

**Story to tell:**
When people say "the consulting industry," they picture McKinsey. Glass towers. Sharp suits. But here's what the industry actually looks like:

85% of consulting firms are one person. Freelancers. Independents. The vast majority of the industry is someone with expertise and a laptop.

The big firms dominate the headlines and the revenue. But the actual structure? It's an iceberg, and most of it is underwater.

**Why this matters:**
Your path into consulting isn't necessarily through a graduate scheme. And if you're a client, the question isn't just "McKinsey or BCG?"—it might be "senior partner from a big firm, or the specialist freelancer who's done this exact thing fifteen times?"

## Slide 2: Not a Global Industry

**Visual:** World map or bar chart showing geographic concentration

**Story to tell:**
Here's another surprise: 70% of global consulting fees come from just five countries—USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada. That's far higher than their share of global GDP.

This isn't just about wealth. Consulting as we know it is a distinctly Anglo-American pattern. Some cultures build knowledge-sharing into industry associations or government institutions. Others develop talent internally rather than importing it. The demand for external advice isn't natural—it's shaped by how a country's economy and culture are organised.

**Why this matters:**
When you work internationally, don't assume consulting works the same way everywhere. What's normal in London may feel foreign in Tokyo or Seoul.

## Slide 3: December 2025

**Visual:** News headline about McKinsey layoffs

**Story to tell:**
In December 2025, McKinsey—the firm that practically invented modern consulting—announced it would cut roughly 10% of its workforce over the next two years.

This wasn't just a market downturn. Something structural is shifting.

For decades, consulting firms ran on a pyramid: hire lots of juniors, have them do the analytical heavy lifting, bill them out at junior rates while partners win business. The juniors who survived got promoted; the rest left. Up or out.

AI is collapsing that model. The analytical work that trained junior consultants—building Excel models, synthesising research, writing first drafts—is increasingly automated. Clients are doing it themselves. The pyramid's base is shrinking.

## Slide 4: Where Value Is Moving

**Visual:** Simple arrow diagram: "What to do" → "How to do it"

**Story to tell:**
Here's the pattern in the numbers: implementation-focused firms—Accenture, Deloitte, the technology consultancies—have been growing roughly twice as fast as pure strategy firms.

The information advantage that justified premium strategy fees is eroding. Clients have access to the same data, the same frameworks, often the same former consultants working in-house.

What's harder to replicate: actually making change happen. Managing stakeholders. Running complex programmes. Getting people to do things differently.

**Key insight:**
If you're building a consulting career, the question isn't just "what do I know?" It's "can I help people act on what they know?" That's where value is shifting.

## Slide 5: The Scrutiny Problem

**Visual:** Brief headlines: McKinsey opioids, PwC tax scandal, Deloitte AI billing

**Story to tell:**
The industry is also facing questions it hasn't had to answer before.

McKinsey paid $650 million to settle claims over its work advising opioid manufacturers. PwC in Australia saw partners share confidential tax information. Consultants have been caught billing for AI-generated work without disclosure.

There's no mandatory professional regulation. No licence to lose. The industry self-polices through reputation—and reputation is taking hits.

**Why this matters:**
If you're going to work in this industry, you need to think about ethics not as compliance but as professional identity. What are you willing to do? What aren't you? Where are the lines?

## Slide 6: Your Reflection

**Visual:** Question prompt

> The written materials cover the industry structure in more detail. As you read, consider: where would you want to position yourself in this landscape—and what does the disruption mean for that choice?

**Bridge:**
Next recording: the different roles consultants play, and why knowing which one you're in matters more than most people realise.

## Overview

This week focuses on **designing solutions** and moving from diagnosis to recommendations. Building on Week 3's data gathering work, we explore how consultants make sense of data, develop evidence-based solutions, navigate ethical challenges, and present recommendations effectively.

:::outcomes
- Identify key attributes of 'good' solutions and pitfalls to be avoided
- Evaluate evidence and identify good evidence that solutions might be based on
- Navigate key ethical issues when designing solutions
- Recognise opportunities for prototyping, pilot testing and establishing learning cycles
- Understand key challenges at this stage of the consultancy cycle

### Position in the consultancy cycle

We're now moving from the **diagnosis** phase into **analyses** and the design of **interventions**. This is where consultants synthesise their findings, develop recommendations, and work with clients to gain acceptance and plan implementation.

Remember: as [@schein1987] emphasises, it is the client who owns both the problem and the solution. The consultant's role is to help the client discover what needs to change and build commitment to action.

### How to use these materials

To prepare for the live session, you should:

1. **Watch the four video recordings** (~90 minutes total), and review the written context, particularly where it extends the videos
2. **Complete the core readings**: Block [-@block2011] Chapter 18, and Sturdy et al. [-@sturdy2009]
3. **Explore at least one topic in depth** through supplementary reading: Ethics, Evidence-based practice, or Solution design

The expandable academic source summaries throughout these materials are **optional enrichment**. They provide deeper context if you're interested, but aren't essential for the live session.

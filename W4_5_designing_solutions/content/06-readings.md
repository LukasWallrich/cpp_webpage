### Core readings

:::reading[core][block2011] Chapter 18
Block's chapter on implementation focuses on the feedback meeting and getting recommendations accepted. It provides practical guidance on structuring meetings for action rather than just information sharing.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What does Block recommend for structuring a feedback meeting?</li>
    <li>How should consultants handle client resistance to recommendations?</li>
    <li>What is the relationship between presenting findings and getting commitment to action?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

:::reading[core][sturdy2009]
This paper critically examines the traditional view that consultants either bring in new ideas (innovation) or validate existing ones (legitimation). The authors argue the reality is more complex, with knowledge flowing in both directions across the consultant-client boundary.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the two dominant views of consultants' role in knowledge transfer?</li>
    <li>How do boundaries function in consulting relationships?</li>
    <li>What does the evidence suggest about how knowledge actually flows in consulting projects?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Optional readings: Ethics

Choose one if you want to explore ethical dimensions more deeply:

:::reading[optional][watson2003]
Not directly about consultancy, but shows how managers can apply ethical principles in dealing with everyday challenges. Uses practical examples to illustrate how ethical choice operates in ambiguous situations.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Watson frame the challenge of ethical choice in organisations?</li>
    <li>What does "ethically irrational" mean in this context?</li>
    <li>How might these frameworks apply to consulting situations?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::

:::reading[optional][omahoney2011]
Interview study examining ethical challenges and practices in UK consultancy firms. Discusses how ethical responsibility is individualised while institutional conflicts of interest remain unaddressed.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What does "ethical individualisation" mean?</li>
    <li>What institutional challenges does the article identify?</li>
    <li>How might consulting firms address ethics more systemically?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Optional readings: Evidence-based practice

Choose one if you want to explore the evidence debate more deeply:

:::reading[optional][briner2019]
A practitioner guide that explains what evidence-based practice is and how you can get started. Introduces the Six As framework and Four Sources of evidence, emphasising that using some evidence is better than none.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the six As of evidence-based practice?</li>
    <li>What sources of evidence does Briner identify?</li>
    <li>How does Briner address common objections to EBP?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::

:::reading[optional][morrelllearmonth2015]
A forceful argument against reliance on evidence-based management. The authors advocate for pluralism, openness and "management learning" as an alternative paradigm.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the main criticisms of evidence-based management?</li>
    <li>What alternative does the article propose?</li>
    <li>Do you find the critique convincing? What are its limitations?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
:::

:::reading[optional][eldredge2024]
An open-access guide to evidence-based practice, focusing on how to search for and appraise evidence. Particularly useful if you want practical guidance on finding research evidence.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What strategies does Eldredge recommend for searching for evidence?</li>
    <li>How should evidence quality be assessed?</li>
    <li>What are the main barriers to evidence-based practice?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Optional readings: Solutions

:::reading[optional][berglundwerr2000]
Highlights how consultants need to balance two contradictory rhetorics in selling their services: rational/objective/expert vs. pragmatic/creative/innovator. Uses practical examples to illustrate how consultants blend these incommensurable approaches.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the two "myths" that consultants draw on?</li>
    <li>How do consultants manage the tension between them?</li>
    <li>What does this mean for how we understand consulting expertise?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Why these perspectives matter

Block writes as a practitioner offering normative advice on how to handle the crucial transition from diagnosis to implementation. Sturdy et al. provide academic analysis of knowledge flows that challenges simplistic views of consulting.

The ethics readings offer different lenses—Watson on individual ethical choice, O'Mahoney on institutional dynamics. The evidence readings present the case for and against evidence-based management.

Together, they cover the practical, analytical, ethical and evidential dimensions of designing and delivering solutions.

## Prepare for the live session

### Preparation checklist

:::checklist
- Watch the four video recordings (~90 minutes total)
- Skim the written content sections
- Complete at least one core reading (Block Chapter 18 OR Sturdy et al. 2009)
- Explore at least one optional topic (ethics, evidence-based practice, or solutions)
- Prepare notes on the discussion questions below
- Review the group assignment brief
:::

### Discussion questions

Reflect on these questions and bring your notes to the live session:

1. **What makes a "good" solution?** Think beyond technical correctness—what other criteria matter for solutions that actually get implemented and make a difference?

2. **How should consultants balance evidence with other considerations?** When is evidence paramount, and when might other factors (values, politics, practical constraints) legitimately take precedence?

3. **What are the key ethical challenges at this stage?** How do ethical considerations differ when designing and presenting solutions compared to the diagnostic phase?

4. **How can consultants build genuine ownership of solutions?** What specific tactics help move from "consultant's recommendation" to "client's solution"?

5. **How do you handle resistance to recommendations?** What strategies work for different types of resistance?

### Live session focus

The live session will be discussion-based rather than additional lecture. We'll explore:

- **Solution design**: How to develop recommendations that are technically sound, evidence-informed, and practically implementable
- **Presenting recommendations**: Structuring feedback for action rather than just information transfer
- **Ethical navigation**: Working through genuine dilemmas rather than easy cases
- **The evidence debate**: When and how to use evidence-based approaches

### Assignment connection

As you work through this week's materials, continue developing your thinking about the assignment:

- What solutions might you recommend for your assignment context?
- How would you ensure your recommendations are evidence-informed?
- How would you present your recommendations to gain acceptance?
- What ethical considerations are relevant to your proposed solutions?

Read the assignment brief and some examples on Moodle if you haven't already.

### Looking ahead

Next week we move to **implementation**: how consultants support clients in putting recommendations into practice, managing change, and sustaining improvements after the engagement ends.

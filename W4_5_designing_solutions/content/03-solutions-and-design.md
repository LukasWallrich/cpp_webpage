Part 2: Designing for adoption
- Microsoft-Nokia: a $7 billion lesson in cultural mismatch
- Armenakis' five beliefs as a design checklist
- Why multiple options matter: diverge then converge
- Design thinking for consultants
- Creative problem-solving: brainwriting vs brainstorming
- Decision matrices and systematic evaluation
- Scenario planning and the pre-mortem technique
- Prototyping, piloting, and learning cycles

This video covers the practical craft of solution design. The Microsoft-Nokia case illustrates why technically sound solutions fail without cultural fit. The key frameworks—Armenakis' five beliefs, decision matrices, scenario planning, and the pre-mortem technique—provide systematic approaches to designing solutions that will actually be adopted.

### Key considerations when deciding on solutions

#### The client context

- What is **out of scope**? What cannot be touched?
- What **needs to be seen** to be addressed?
- Remember: only solutions that might be implemented can be the "right" ones

#### Quality of your solutions

How well do your solutions:
- **Link to your data analysis?**
- **Address the (real) underlying problem?**
- **Correspond to the evidence base?**

#### Fit to consultancy

- Does the solution fit your consultancy's capabilities?
- If not, can you credibly support it? Should you partner with specialists?
- Have you genuinely considered a range of options?

### Armenakis' five beliefs

Armenakis et al. [-@armenakis1993] identify five beliefs that shape whether recipients support change. Use these as a **design checklist**—not just implementation tactics:

| Belief | Design question |
|---|---|
| **Discrepancy** | Will people believe change is necessary? |
| **Appropriateness** | Will they believe this is the right change? |
| **Efficacy** | Will they believe they can actually do it? |
| **Principal support** | Will they believe leaders are truly committed? |
| **Valence** | What's in it for them personally? |

If your solution fails on any of these beliefs, consider redesigning it before presenting.

Think about a recommendation you've made or received that wasn't implemented. What factors contributed to the gap between recommendation and action?

### Extension: The options paper approach

How you present recommendations affects whether they're adopted. The **options paper** format structures recommendations as choices rather than mandates:

1. **Context**: What's the situation? What problem are we solving?
2. **Options**: Three or more genuine alternatives, with trade-offs honestly presented
3. **Evaluation**: How do options compare against agreed criteria?
4. **Recommendation**: Which option do you recommend, and why?

You still make a recommendation—you're not abdicating judgement. But you're inviting the client into a decision rather than asking them to accept or reject your verdict. This builds ownership: the client isn't defending your idea—they're choosing among alternatives they helped evaluate.

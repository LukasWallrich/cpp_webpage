This video covers the practical craft of solution design. The Microsoft-Nokia case illustrates why technically sound solutions fail without cultural fit. The key frameworks—Armenakis' five beliefs, decision matrices, scenario planning, and the pre-mortem technique—provide systematic approaches to designing solutions that will actually be adopted.

### Key considerations when deciding on solutions

#### The client context

- What is **out of scope**? What cannot be touched?
- What **needs to be seen** to be addressed?
- Remember: only solutions that might be implemented can be the "right" ones

#### Quality of your solutions

How well do your solutions:
- **Link to your data analysis?**
- **Address the (real) underlying problem?**
- **Correspond to the evidence base?**

#### Fit to consultancy

- Does the solution fit your consultancy's capabilities?
- If not, can you credibly support it? Should you partner with specialists?
- Have you genuinely considered a range of options?

### Armenakis' five beliefs

Armenakis et al. [-@armenakis1993] identify five beliefs that shape whether recipients support change. Use these as a **design checklist**—not just implementation tactics:

| Belief | Design question |
|---|---|
| **Discrepancy** | Will people believe change is necessary? |
| **Appropriateness** | Will they believe this is the right change? |
| **Efficacy** | Will they believe they can actually do it? |
| **Principal support** | Will they believe leaders are truly committed? |
| **Valence** | What's in it for them personally? |

If your solution fails on any of these beliefs, consider redesigning it before presenting.

Think about a recommendation you've made or received that wasn't implemented. What factors contributed to the gap between recommendation and action?

### Extension: The options paper approach

How you present recommendations affects whether they're adopted. The **options paper** format structures recommendations as choices rather than mandates:

1. **Context**: What's the situation? What problem are we solving?
2. **Options**: Three or more genuine alternatives, with trade-offs honestly presented
3. **Evaluation**: How do options compare against agreed criteria?
4. **Recommendation**: Which option do you recommend, and why?

You still make a recommendation—you're not abdicating judgement. But you're inviting the client into a decision rather than asking them to accept or reject your verdict. This builds ownership: the client isn't defending your idea—they're choosing among alternatives they helped evaluate.

Sturdy, Clark, Fincham & Handley (2009) "Between Innovation and Legitimation—Boundaries and Knowledge Flow in Management Consultancy", *Organization*

This study challenges simple views of consultants as either innovators (bringing in new knowledge) or legitimators (validating internal ideas). Through examining consulting projects, the authors find that knowledge flows in both directions and boundaries between consultant and client knowledge are more fluid than typically assumed.

**Key insight**: The distinction between "new" ideas from consultants and "existing" ideas from clients is often artificial—effective consulting involves complex knowledge co-production.

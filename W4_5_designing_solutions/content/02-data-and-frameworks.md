## Part 2: Making Sense of Data & Using Frameworks

This section covers the practical skills of **making sense of data** and **using frameworks**—essential groundwork for designing effective solutions.

### Making sense of data

The purpose of data gathering is to get action. This means your data needs to be processed in ways that enable decision-making:

:::summary
Raw data rarely speaks for itself. The consultant's task is to transform interview transcripts, survey responses, financial figures and observations into a coherent narrative that answers the question: *so what?*

This means ruthless prioritisation—surfacing the three or four findings that matter most, rather than cataloguing everything you learned. It means weaving together different data sources to tell a story that's more compelling than any single source alone. And it means being honest about what the data shows, even when that's uncomfortable.

### Things to avoid

Several pitfalls can undermine even good diagnostic work:

**Misrepresentation** (especially fooling yourself)
- Misleading graphs that distort relationships
- Halo effects where one positive or negative finding colours everything
- Cherry-picking data that supports pre-existing views

**Death by PowerPoint**
- The medium should fit the message
- A presentation is not a conversation
- Sometimes less formal approaches work better

**Ambiguity of purpose**
Different meetings require different approaches:
- Share options backed by data to frame a decision?
- Share summary to galvanise joint solution design?
- Share data and support sense-making?

Internally, you will need all of these, but be clear about which mode you're in with the client.

Think of a presentation you've seen that was ineffective. What made it hard to follow or act upon? How might data have been presented differently to enable action?

### The use of frameworks

Frameworks are ways to make sense of situations—categories, questions to consider, tools for thinking, ways to structure conversations.

As Kahneman [-@kahneman2011] notes, analogy is the core of cognition. We understand new situations by relating them to familiar patterns.

:::definition
"Frameworks help us see what we might otherwise miss, organise what we find, and communicate what we know. They are scaffolding for thought, not substitutes for it."
:::

But frameworks are **not**:
- Recipes that will do the thinking work for you
- Jargon to use to "sound like a consultant"
- Universal truths that apply in all situations

Effective frameworks can be co-created with and tailored to the client context.

### Types of frameworks

**Generic frameworks** help understand any situation better:
- SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
- PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)

**Question-specific frameworks** address particular issues:
- Porter's Five Forces (competitive positioning)
- 4 Ps / 7 Ps (marketing strategy)

**Task-specific frameworks** guide particular activities:
- McKinsey's Influence Model (enabling change)

### McKinsey's Influence Model

This framework identifies four building blocks for enabling organisational change:

<div class="influence-grid">
<div class="influence-box role-model">

#### Role modelling
Do leaders behave consistently with the change?

</div>
<div class="influence-box conviction">

#### Understanding & conviction
Do people understand why change is needed?

</div>
<div class="influence-box skills">

#### Talent & skills
Do people have the capabilities required?

</div>
<div class="influence-box mechanisms">

#### Formal mechanisms
Do systems, processes and incentives support the change?

</div>
</div>

The model emphasises that sustainable change requires attention to all four areas—addressing only one or two typically fails.

:::reflect
Think about a framework you've used or encountered. When was it helpful? When might it have constrained your thinking or missed important aspects of the situation?

### Building your toolkit

O'Mahoney and Markham [-@omahoney2013] identify numerous frameworks consultants use. Key ones include:

- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Quantifying trade-offs
- **Pareto principle (80:20)**: Focusing on vital few factors
- **McKinsey 7S**: Understanding organisational alignment
- **Cultural Web**: Mapping organisational culture
- **Burke-Litwin model**: Understanding change dynamics

The goal is not to memorise all frameworks but to develop a repertoire you can draw on flexibly, selecting and adapting tools to fit each situation.

Part 4: Ethics without easy answers
- The missing regulator: why consulting lacks external oversight
- Case studies in ethical failure: Enron, the opioid crisis, South Africa state capture, Big Four exam cheating
- Ethical individualisation: when institutions dump conflicts on individuals
- Watson's framework for ethical choice
- BCG and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation: when employee pressure works
- Where are your lines? When to walk away
:::

This video examines the ethical challenges unique to consulting. Unlike medicine or law, consulting has no external regulator—nobody can be "struck off." The video explores high-profile ethical failures, the phenomenon of "ethical individualisation" where firms push moral responsibility onto individuals, and Watson's framework for navigating ethical choices.

O'Mahoney (2011) "Advisory Anxieties: Ethical Individualisation in the UK Consulting Industry", *Journal of Business Ethics*

Through interviews with UK consultants, O'Mahoney finds that ethical responsibility is devolved to individuals while institutional structures that create ethical conflicts remain unaddressed. The paper argues that an individualised ethics is incapable of preventing malpractice in the face of institutional conflicts of interest.

**Key insight**: The focus on individual ethics serves firms' PR purposes while leaving systemic issues untouched.

### Professional body guidelines

Some guidelines exist, though without regulatory teeth:

**Institute of Management Consultants (USA)** highlights:
- Safeguarding confidential information
- Rendering impartial, independent advice
- Developing realistic and practical solutions to client problems

**Management Consultancies Association (UK)** has codified a Chartered Management Consultant competency framework highlighting:
- Key values: eminence, inclusivity, courage of convictions
- Key behaviours: include ethics in solution design, create positive impact for all stakeholders

**International Council of Management Consulting Institutes (ICMCI)** provides a global framework for ethical standards.

### Everyday ethical practices

Some practical ethical considerations for consulting engagements:

| Domain | Consideration |
|---|---|
| **Confidentiality** | What can be shared with whom? How is data protected? |
| **Consent** | Are participants genuinely free to decline? |
| **Conflicts of interest** | Are there competing loyalties? Who benefits? |
| **Competence** | Are you truly qualified to do this work? |
| **Power dynamics** | How do you avoid reinforcing harmful patterns? |

**Important note from Stewart & Rigg [-@stewartrigg2011]**: Groups we help form (e.g., focus groups) typically mirror the socio-dynamics of the organisation—recreating power imbalances and inequities. We can create environments that silence and disempower some participants unless we consciously reshape them.

What ethical lines would you not cross? Are there clients, industries, or project types you would refuse? How would you know when you were approaching a line?

### Formal requirements

Some contexts have additional requirements:

- **Public sector organisations** may not permit "intervention" or "consultancy" without ethical review, particularly if collecting primary data
- **Commissioning clients** may require environmental policies, data protection policies, proof of duty of care (insurance, quality management), or signing up to voluntary codes of conduct

### Ethics and evidence

There's an interesting intersection between ethics and evidence-based practice:

- Using evidence is arguably an ethical obligation—basing recommendations on gut feeling when better evidence exists could cause harm
- But evidence doesn't remove ethical choices—values legitimately shape which evidence matters and how to weigh competing considerations
- The "cult of evidence" can be used to dismiss legitimate concerns that don't fit easily into quantitative frameworks

A thoughtful consultant holds both in tension: committed to evidence while recognising its limits, and to ethics while acknowledging complexity.

Think of a time when you faced an ethical dilemma at work. How did you navigate it? What would you do differently with the benefit of hindsight?

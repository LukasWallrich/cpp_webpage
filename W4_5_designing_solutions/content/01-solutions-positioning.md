Part 1: Between innovation and legitimation
- Where do solutions come from? Three pathways (problem-seeks-solution, solution-seeks-problem, co-production)
- The innovation–legitimation spectrum: bringing something new vs. validating what the client suspects
- The rhetoric game: balancing expert and creative positioning
- Quality criteria for solution design: data quality, problem fit, stakeholder readiness
- What makes advice stick: costly, future-focused, relationally grounded
- Giving up the hero narrative
:::

This video explores the strategic positioning of consulting recommendations. It examines the three pathways through which solutions emerge, the tension between innovation and legitimation, and how consultants navigate between "expert" and "creative" rhetorics. Key themes—particularly around solution quality and what makes advice stick—are developed further in Part 3.

### The rhetoric game

Berglund and Werr [-@berglundwerr2000] found that consultants simultaneously deploy two seemingly incompatible rhetorics:

<div class="rhetoric-grid">
<div class="rhetoric-box expert">

#### Expert rhetoric
"We bring rigorous methodology and superior knowledge. Trust our analysis."

*Emphasises: systematic methods, proven frameworks, analytical rigour*

</div>
<div class="rhetoric-box creative">

#### Creative rhetoric
"We're flexible practitioners who adapt to your unique situation. We'll craft something bespoke."

*Emphasises: tailored solutions, collaborative discovery, contextual sensitivity*

</div>
</div>

These are contradictory—you can't be both purely rigorous and completely flexible. But consultants blend them seamlessly, emphasising whichever is needed in the moment.

Think about a consulting recommendation you've seen or experienced. Was it primarily innovation (something genuinely new) or legitimation (validating what the client already believed)? How did this positioning affect how it was received?

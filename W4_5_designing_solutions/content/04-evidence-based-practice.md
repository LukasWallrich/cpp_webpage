Part 3: The evidence challenge
- The case for evidence: reducing the odds of being wrong
- The Six As and Four Sources frameworks
- When evidence gets ignored: Scared Straight programs, open-plan offices, Kodak, Nokia, Blockbuster
- The bandwagon effect: following evidence too uncritically
- Whose success? What timeframe? The politics of measurement
- Critical perspectives: Morrell & Learmonth's challenge to EBM
- Holding the tension: rigorous AND humble

This video introduces evidence-based practice for consultants. It covers the Six As framework (Ask, Acquire, Appraise, Aggregate, Apply, Assess) and the Four Sources of evidence (stakeholder views, practitioner expertise, organisational data, scientific literature). The video also examines cases where evidence was ignored and critiques of the EBM paradigm.

This practitioner guide explains what evidence-based practice (EBP) is and how to get started. Briner argues that EBP is not complicated or revolutionary—it simply extends the everyday principle that using evidence increases our chances of getting desired outcomes.

**The Six As framework**:
1. **Ask**: Translate problems into answerable questions
2. **Acquire**: Gather evidence from multiple sources
3. **Appraise**: Judge the trustworthiness and relevance of evidence
4. **Aggregate**: Pull together the best available evidence (not all evidence)
5. **Apply**: Use evidence to inform decisions
6. **Assess**: Evaluate the outcomes of decisions taken

**Four sources of evidence**: Scientific literature, organisational data, stakeholders' concerns, and professional expertise. Each source answers different questions; relying on only one or two gives an incomplete picture.

**Key insight**: EBP is not about perfection or proving anything for certain—using some evidence is better than using none, and using more evidence is likely to be better still.

### Assessing evidence quality

Not all evidence is equal. Consider the "evidence pyramid":

| Level | Type of Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Strongest** | Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of multiple robust studies |
| **Strong** | Randomised controlled trials |
| **Moderate** | Robust experimental research, prospective studies, cohort comparisons |
| **Weaker** | Correlational studies, case series with before/after comparisons |
| **Weakest** | Case studies, expert opinions, anecdotal evidence |

Also consider the source: peer-reviewed journal vs. consultancy report vs. magazine article vs. press coverage.

Think about a recommendation you've made or received. What evidence was it based on? Where would that evidence sit on the pyramid? What stronger evidence might have been available?

### Finding evidence: Knowledge brokers

Finding and appraising evidence is hard work. Several resources can help:

**Knowledge brokers**
- Campbell Collaboration: high-quality systematic reviews for social science
- What Works Centres: evidence synthesis for policy areas
- Closest to our area: What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth

**Professional bodies**
- CIPD provides evidence summaries for HR topics
- Various industry bodies synthesise research for practitioners

Consultants could play a knowledge broker role—but this potential is rarely fully realised.

### Requirements for evidence-based diagnosis

McFillen et al. [-@mcfillen2013] identify six components needed for truly evidence-based organisational diagnosis:

1. Established, accepted methods and measures for diagnosis
2. Accepted and quantifiable norms for assessment (standards)
3. Clearly defined system components and knowledge of subsystem interactions
4. Known cause-effect relationships among symptoms and causes
5. Known cause-effect relationships among causes and treatments/interventions
6. Known cause-effect relationships among treatments and changes in symptoms

The authors note that management rarely achieves the levels of certainty that medicine has developed—but that shouldn't prevent us from using the best evidence available.

:::source[morrelllearmonth2015]
This paper challenges the EBM paradigm, arguing it risks importing inappropriate medical models into management. The authors advocate for intellectual pluralism, flexibility, multiple perspectives, openness, dialogue, and questioning of basic assumptions.

**Key insight**: The "medicine as management motif" may be fundamentally flawed because management contexts are more varied, contested and political than medical ones.

Where do you sit on the EBP debate? Are there domains where evidence should be paramount? Where might other considerations legitimately take precedence?

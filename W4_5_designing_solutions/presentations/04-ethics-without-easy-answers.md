> "Ethics Without Easy Answers"

**Story to tell:**
Let me start with a quote from Joe O'Mahoney's research. In interviews with UK consultants, he found that inherent "contradictions and conflicts" in consulting practice are ultimately "dumped at the feet of the individual."

What does that mean in practice? It means consultants face ethical dilemmas without the backstop that other professions provide. There's no licensing body. No disciplinary tribunal. No mechanism to "strike off" practitioners who cross lines.

The freedom of consulting comes with a weight: you must develop your own ethical compass. And sometimes, the ethical choice is to walk away.

## Slide 2: The Missing Regulator

**Visual:** Comparison table: Medicine, Law, Consulting

**Story to tell:**
Consider the contrast with established professions.

In medicine, you must complete accredited training, pass licensing exams, and maintain registration. A medical council can investigate complaints and remove your right to practise. There are real consequences for malpractice.

In law, similar structures exist. Solicitors and barristers face regulatory bodies with investigative and disciplinary powers.

In management consulting? Nothing comparable. Anyone can call themselves a consultant. There's no mandatory qualification. No licensing. No external body that can remove you from practice.

This means market reputation is the only enforcement mechanism—and reputation moves slowly, often long after damage is done.

**Key insight:**
Without external regulation, ethical responsibility falls entirely on you. There's no backstop if you get it wrong.

## Slide 3: McKinsey and the Opioid Crisis

**Visual:** Timeline: 2004-2024, from Purdue engagement to criminal settlement

**Story to tell:**
Let me tell you about the most significant consulting ethics case in history.

McKinsey advised Purdue Pharma over fifteen years on how to sell OxyContin. They helped identify "high value prescribers"—doctors writing the most opioid prescriptions, including some writing prescriptions for unsafe uses. McKinsey earned $93 million for this work.

In December 2024, McKinsey paid $650 million to resolve a criminal investigation. It was the first time a management consulting firm was held criminally responsible for advising a client to break the law. A former senior partner pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for deleting documents and faces up to 20 years in prison.

The opioid crisis has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. McKinsey's statement: "We should not have undertaken sales and marketing work for Purdue Pharma. This terrible public health crisis and our past work for opioid manufacturers will always be a source of profound regret."

**Key insight:**
This wasn't one rogue employee. It was systemic engagement over many years. The institutional structures that should have stopped it didn't.

## Slide 4: South Africa State Capture

**Visual:** Map of South Africa with Bain and McKinsey logos

**Story to tell:**
Another case that reveals institutional failure. In South Africa, both McKinsey and Bain were implicated in "state capture"—working with politically connected families to extract value from state institutions.

McKinsey partnered with Gupta-linked firms for contracts at state enterprises Transnet and Eskom. A former McKinsey partner colluded with the Gupta family's operations. McKinsey settled for R1.1 billion (about $60 million) and pleaded guilty to violating the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Bain's case was perhaps worse. Their restructuring of the South African Revenue Service "destroyed a large part of its capacity"—deliberately weakening the state's ability to collect taxes. The UK Cabinet Office banned Bain from government contracts for three years, citing "grave professional misconduct."

**Key insight:**
These weren't mistakes. They were sustained engagements where institutional incentives overrode ethical judgment. Individuals may have had doubts—but the system continued.

## Slide 5: Arthur Andersen's Collapse

**Visual:** Arthur Andersen office with Enron logo

**Story to tell:**
Let me go back further to the foundational consulting ethics case. Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees from Enron in 2000 alone. The lead auditor had an annual performance goal of 20% increase in sales.

When Enron's fraud began unravelling, Andersen's response was to accelerate document destruction. When the SEC requested documents, partner David Duncan ordered shredding.

The consequences: 25,000 Enron employees lost jobs. $2 billion in pension savings vanished. $1.2 billion in retirement funds disappeared.

For Arthur Andersen: 85,000 employees lost jobs. The firm dissolved entirely.

And from the wreckage, we got Sarbanes-Oxley—regulation imposed because the profession couldn't regulate itself.

**Key insight:**
When consulting firms face conflicts of interest—audit vs. consulting, short-term sales vs. long-term ethics—the structural incentives often win.

**Go deeper:** The written content explores institutional codes and their limitations in detail.

## Slide 6: Ethical Individualisation

**Visual:** O'Mahoney quote: contradictions "dumped at the feet of the individual"

**Story to tell:**
O'Mahoney's research identified a pattern he calls "ethical individualisation." Here's how it works:

Consulting firms develop ethics training—but it focuses on low-level issues. Don't accept expensive gifts. Be careful with confidential information. Basic stuff that no reasonable person would dispute.

Meanwhile, organisation-level challenges remain untouched: conflicts of interest between audit and consulting, pressure to sell follow-on work, taking credit for client achievements, promising more than can be delivered.

Firms offer "feel-good" corporate volunteering that creates positive PR. But the structural incentives creating ethical problems stay intact.

The result: individual consultants bear the weight of ethical choices while institutional structures make those choices difficult.

**Key insight:**
"Be ethical" isn't enough when the system you work in creates ethical traps. Individual virtue can't compensate for institutional design.

## Slide 7: Big Four Exam Cheating

**Visual:** PCAOB fines: $8.5 million across Deloitte, PwC, EY

**Story to tell:**
One more case that reveals something about institutional culture. In 2018-2022, widespread exam cheating was discovered across Deloitte, PwC, and EY Netherlands. The cheating was on mandatory professional training—including, ironically, ethics assessments.

The misconduct involved staff from junior employees all the way to executive board members. Deloitte Netherlands' chief quality officer resigned after receiving test answers. KPMG's former head of assurance was permanently barred from practice.

Think about what this means: professionals at the highest levels, working in "ethics" roles, were cheating on ethics exams. The institutional culture didn't just fail to prevent this—it apparently normalised it.

**Key insight:**
Institutional culture shapes individual behaviour. "A few bad apples" explanations miss the systemic patterns.

## Slide 8: Watson's Framework for Ethical Choice

**Visual:** Five steps: Recognise, Consider, Apply, Weigh, Take responsibility

**Story to tell:**
Given all this, how should individual consultants navigate ethical terrain? Watson offers a framework:

*Recognise the ethical dimension*. This sounds obvious but isn't. Many ethical issues get framed as technical or commercial questions. The first step is noticing that an ethical dimension exists.

*Consider stakeholder interests*. Who is affected by this decision? Not just the client who's paying, but employees, customers, communities, the broader system.

*Apply ethical principles*. What would a person of integrity do? What principles matter to you?

*Weigh competing considerations*. Ethics rarely provides clear single answers. Different principles may point different directions. This is where judgment comes in.

*Take responsibility*. Own the decision and its consequences. Don't hide behind "I was just following orders" or "that's what the client wanted."

**Key insight:**
Ethical practice isn't about following rules. It's about developing the judgment to navigate competing considerations with integrity.

**Go deeper:** The written content provides the full Watson framework and application examples.

## Slide 9: Where Are Your Lines?

**Visual:** Blank lines for viewer to complete

**Story to tell:**
Let me pose some questions. Not to answer now, but to think about:

Which industries would you refuse to work with? Arms manufacturers? Fossil fuel companies? Gambling? Tobacco?

Which clients would you decline? Governments with poor human rights records? Companies with exploitative labour practices?

Which project aims would you reject? Helping a client avoid legitimate taxation? Optimising layoff processes? Producing reports you know will be used to justify decisions already made?

There are no universal right answers. But having thought through your lines in advance matters—because in the moment, pressure and rationalisation are powerful.

**Key insight:**
If you haven't decided where your lines are before you face them, you're more likely to cross them.

## Slide 10: When to Walk Away

**Visual:** Exit door

**Story to tell:**
Sometimes the ethical choice is to decline or exit an engagement.

Walk away when you cannot deliver what the client actually needs—when continuing would be taking money for value you can't provide.

Walk away when the project aims conflict with your values—when success as defined would mean something you can't endorse.

Walk away when you're being asked to legitimise a predetermined conclusion—when your role is to provide cover rather than genuine analysis.

Walk away when continuing would cause harm—to employees, to communities, to the broader system.

This is hard. There are financial pressures, relationship pressures, career pressures. But consultants who can't say no aren't independent advisors. They're hired hands.

**Key insight:**
Walking away is sometimes the highest form of professional service—refusing to be complicit in harm.

## Slide 11: BCG and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation

**Visual:** BCG withdrawal announcement

**Story to tell:**
Let me end with a recent case that shows ethical pressure can work.

BCG began work in late 2023 on what would become the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation—an aid distribution organisation backed by Israeli and US governments. When the foundation launched in early 2025, reports emerged that BCG consultants had modelled "redevelopment and resettlement scenarios" including financial incentives for Palestinians to relocate—scenarios that UN officials likened to ethnic cleansing.

After internal employee backlash and public criticism, BCG withdrew from the engagement in June 2025. Two partners were fired for what BCG called "unauthorized" work that didn't meet firm standards. The CEO issued a public apology, admitting "process failures."

This case shows both the problem and a glimmer of hope: consultants can push back. Internal voices can matter. Walking away is possible—even if it takes public pressure.

**Key insight:**
Employee conscience isn't powerless. But it requires willingness to speak up—and to accept consequences.

## Slide 12: Final Thoughts

**Visual:** Summary of four recordings

**Story to tell:**
Let me close this week's recordings by connecting the threads.

Recommendations work best when they emerge from genuine co-production—when clients see them as arising from their own situation, not imposed from outside.

Getting buy-in requires understanding what people believe, not just presenting data. Low resistance isn't high readiness.

Evidence matters, but it's not everything. The real skill is knowing when evidence helps and when other considerations legitimately take precedence.

And ethics can't be delegated. Without external regulation, you must develop your own framework—and be prepared to walk away.

None of this is easy. But it's what makes consulting something more than just exchanging time for money.

**Reflection prompt:** Think about an ethical line you would not cross. How would you know if you were approaching it? What would it take for you to walk away?

# Recording 1: Between Innovation and Legitimation

**Duration:** ~12 minutes
**Slides:** 1-12
**Core message:** Consultants operate between bringing genuinely new ideas and validating what clients already suspect. Understanding which role you're playing—and how solutions actually emerge—shapes everything about how you design recommendations.

## Slide 1: Title

> "Between Innovation and Legitimation"

**Story to tell:**
Here's an uncomfortable question for consultants: Are you bringing something new, or confirming what the client already suspects?

This isn't a trick question. Both are valuable. Sometimes what an organisation needs most isn't a new idea—it's permission to act on one they already have.

But here's the thing: the answer shapes everything about how you design your recommendations. If you're innovating, you need to build the case from the ground up. If you're legitimating, you need to understand what the client already believes and why they need external validation.

This recording explores that tension—and how understanding it leads to better solution design.

## Slide 2: Three Pathways to Solutions

**Visual:** Table showing problem-seeks-solution, solution-seeks-problem, and co-production

**Story to tell:**
Let's start with a fundamental question: where do solutions actually come from? There are three pathways:

*Problem seeks solution*. The textbook version: client has a problem, consultant diagnoses it, recommendation follows logically. This happens—but less often than we pretend.

*Solution seeks problem*. More common than we admit. A consultancy has a methodology they're good at—say, Lean Six Sigma or digital transformation—and they frame whatever the client is struggling with as amenable to that solution. This isn't necessarily bad, but it requires honesty about what you're doing.

*Co-production*. The solution is neither purely consultant-generated nor purely client-driven—it emerges from the interaction. As we discussed in Week 2, clients adapt recommendations "like recipes from cookbooks to suit their own tastes."

**Key insight:**
The pathway matters because it shapes ownership. Solutions that emerge from co-production tend to stick; solutions imposed from outside often don't.

## Slide 3: Innovation vs. Legitimation

**Visual:** Sturdy et al. framework showing the spectrum

**Story to tell:**
Sturdy and colleagues studied what consultants actually contribute. They found that consultants operate in a space "between innovation and legitimation."

Sometimes they bring genuinely new ideas—approaches the client couldn't have generated internally. That's innovation.

But often they provide external validation for decisions clients have already made—or are leaning toward. That's legitimation.

Here's the crucial insight: legitimation isn't inferior to innovation. It's a different service. A CEO who suspects a restructuring is needed but can't prove it may need a consultant not for new ideas, but for the analysis and external credibility to act on the idea they already have.

**Key insight:**
The problem comes when consultants don't recognise which role they're playing—and design their work accordingly.

## Slide 4: Designing for Innovation

**Visual:** Checklist for innovation-focused engagements

**Story to tell:**
When you're genuinely innovating—bringing ideas the client couldn't generate internally—the design challenge is building acceptance for something unfamiliar.

You need to:
- Build the case from first principles, because you can't rely on existing beliefs
- Anticipate scepticism—"we've tried that before" or "that won't work here"
- Create opportunities for the client to experience the idea, not just hear about it
- Find internal champions who can translate your outsider perspective

The risk in innovation mode is arrogance: assuming you know better than people who've worked in the organisation for years. The best innovations build on client knowledge rather than dismissing it.

**Key insight:**
Innovation requires humility about what you don't know, combined with confidence in what you bring.

## Slide 5: Designing for Legitimation

**Visual:** Checklist for legitimation-focused engagements

**Story to tell:**
When you're legitimating—validating what the client already suspects—the design challenge is different. You're not building belief from scratch; you're providing evidence and external credibility for beliefs that already exist.

You need to:
- Understand what the client already believes and why
- Identify who needs convincing and what evidence would move them
- Provide the rigour and documentation that internal advocates lack
- Position your work so it empowers the client, not replaces them

The risk in legitimation mode is becoming a rubber stamp—confirming whatever the client wants to hear regardless of the evidence. Good legitimation validates what's genuinely valid; it doesn't manufacture support for bad ideas.

**Key insight:**
Legitimation done well strengthens good decisions. Legitimation done poorly enables bad ones.

## Slide 6: The Rhetoric Game

**Visual:** Berglund & Werr quote about balancing expert and creative rhetoric

**Story to tell:**
Berglund and Werr studied how consultants talk about their work. They found something fascinating: consultants simultaneously deploy two incompatible rhetorics.

The *expert rhetoric* says: "We bring rigorous methodology and superior knowledge. Trust our analysis."

The *creative rhetoric* says: "We're flexible practitioners who adapt to your unique situation. We'll craft something bespoke."

These are contradictory—you can't be both purely rigorous and completely flexible. But consultants blend them seamlessly, emphasising whichever is needed in the moment.

This isn't cynical—it reflects the genuine tension in consulting work. But it does mean we should be thoughtful about how we position our contributions and which rhetoric serves the client best.

**Key insight:**
How you frame your recommendation shapes how it's received. Match your positioning to what the client actually needs.

## Slide 7: The Solution-Seeks-Problem Trap

**Visual:** Hammer looking for nails

**Story to tell:**
Let me illustrate the "solution seeks problem" pathway with a concrete example.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator remains wildly popular in consulting engagements, despite psychologists calling it "little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie" with questionable predictive validity.

Why does it persist? Because it's easy to administer, clients enjoy it, and it creates memorable team bonding moments. The emotional resonance matters more than the scientific validity.

This isn't unique to MBTI. Every consultancy has methodologies they're skilled at and eager to apply. The trap is seeing every client problem through the lens of your favourite solution.

**Key insight:**
Check yourself: are you recommending this because it fits the problem, or because it's what you know how to deliver?

## Slide 8: Quality Criteria for Solution Design

**Visual:** Framework showing data quality, problem fit, stakeholder readiness

**Story to tell:**
What makes a solution well-designed? Three dimensions matter:

*Data quality*: Is your recommendation grounded in solid evidence? Have you triangulated across sources? Are you distinguishing facts from assumptions?

*Problem fit*: Does your solution address the real problem—not just the presenting problem? Sometimes what looks like a structural issue is actually a relationship problem. Sometimes what looks like a skills gap is actually a motivation gap.

*Stakeholder readiness*: Have you designed for the people who need to act? A technically perfect solution that key stakeholders can't or won't implement isn't a solution at all.

**Key insight:**
Evaluate your recommendations against all three dimensions. Excellence in one doesn't compensate for weakness in another.

## Slide 9: What Makes Advice Stick?

**Visual:** Three factors: costly, future-focused, relationally grounded

**Story to tell:**
Research by Kevin Mole found interesting patterns in when advice actually gets acted upon:

First, advice is taken more seriously when it's *costly to obtain*. Free advice gets ignored; advice you paid for feels more valuable. There's something psychologically significant about having skin in the game.

Second, advice that *emphasises the future* rather than dwelling on the past is more likely to be implemented. Forward-looking guidance energises; backward-looking analysis creates defensiveness.

Third, the *relationship matters*. Rapport, experience, and willingness to challenge all affect whether advice lands.

**Key insight:**
How you deliver recommendations matters as much as what they contain. Design for action, not just analysis.

## Slide 10: Giving Up the Hero Narrative

**Visual:** "Consultant as hero" crossed out

**Story to tell:**
The hero narrative is seductive: you're the outsider who sees what insiders miss, arrives with superior tools, saves the struggling organisation.

But that narrative creates problems for solution design:

It breeds arrogance that blinds you to what clients know. It creates dependency rather than capability. And it sets you up for blame when things go wrong—because you positioned yourself as the one with all the answers.

Process consultation—the approach Schein developed—takes the opposite view. The client owns the problem and the solution. Your job is to help them see more clearly, not to rescue them.

This isn't just philosophy—it has practical implications. Solutions designed collaboratively get implemented; solutions imposed heroically get resisted.

**Key insight:**
Giving up the hero role feels like diminishment. It's actually liberation—and it leads to better-designed solutions.

## Slide 11: Where Value Really Lives

**Visual:** Two paths diverging — "Innovation: value in the idea" vs "Legitimation: value in the execution"

**Story to tell:**
Here's the implication that changes how you design your work.

In innovation mode, the idea itself is valuable. You're bringing something the client couldn't generate internally. The recommendation has worth even before implementation begins.

But in legitimation mode? The idea isn't new—the client already had it. So where does your value come from? It comes through implementation. Your contribution is enabling action that wouldn't otherwise happen: providing the evidence, the external credibility, the political cover, the structured process that turns a hunch into a decision.

This means legitimation engagements must obsess over adoptability. If the recommendation doesn't get implemented, you've added nothing—the client already knew what you told them. Your value is realised only when something actually changes.

**Key insight:**
In legitimation mode especially, designing for adoption isn't optional—it's where your entire value proposition lives.

## Slide 12: Bridge to Next Recording

**Visual:** Preview of "Designing for Adoption"

**Story to tell:**
This is why the next recording matters so much. If your value comes through implementation—and in legitimation mode it does—then designing for adoption isn't a nice-to-have. It's the core of what you're delivering.

We'll explore practical tools: pre-mortems that surface hidden risks, decision matrices that make trade-offs explicit, scenario planning that stress-tests solutions against uncertain futures. All of them help you design recommendations that don't just look good on paper—they actually happen.

**Reflection prompt:** Think about a time someone told you something you already knew. Did it change anything? What would have made it more likely to lead to action?

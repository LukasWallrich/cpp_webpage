## 1. Client-Consultant Relationships

### The Validation Trap: When Consultants Become Rubber Stamps

**F5 DevCentral case example:**
> "By kicking a percentage of the cost over to a consulting firm, a rubber stamp of the selection was purchased, but the organization was not served."

The article describes a case where a consulting firm rubber-stamped a technology selection that was more expensive and took longer than alternatives would have. The client wanted validation, not advice.

### The Enron-McKinsey Entanglement

**Background:** Jeff Skilling was a McKinsey partner who consulted to Enron before being hired as CEO of Enron's Capital and Trade Resources division in 1990. McKinsey continued advising Enron for 18 years, earning approximately $100 million per year in consulting fees.

**What happened:** McKinsey consultants sat in on boardroom presentations to Enron's directors. Many of Enron's core strategies—"asset-light," "loose-tight" culture, securitization of debt—were promoted by McKinsey consultants.

**The boundary blur:** Skilling brought McKinsey's "war for talent" culture into Enron, creating a highly competitive, cut-throat environment. Multiple McKinsey alumni worked at Enron, including Rex Shelby who was involved in Enron Broadband Services.

**The aftermath:** After Enron's collapse in 2001, McKinsey absolved itself of responsibility, saying it was "not an adviser on financial and reporting matters." However, up until the collapse, McKinsey was promoting Enron's business model—including its off-balance sheet accounting—and encouraging others to follow suit. Skilling was convicted of federal felony charges in 2006 and sentenced to 24 years in prison.

### McKinsey's Conflict of Interest Patterns

**From "When McKinsey Comes to Town" (Bogdanich & Forsythe, 2022):**

The book reveals that McKinsey has simultaneously advised:
- Ford AND General Motors
- The FDA AND Purdue Pharma (during the opioid crisis)
- The New York Times AND the Washington Post
- The US government (64 contracts in 2016) AND Saudi Arabia (137 projects)

**The FDA/Opioid case:** McKinsey consultants were simultaneously working for the FDA on opioid regulations and for Purdue Pharma to promote OxyContin. An investigation found McKinsey's internal firewall was "porous at best"—consultants advising Purdue were allowed to provide input on materials being prepared for incoming HHS secretary Alex Azar in 2018, removing language they considered "hyperbolic" like "crisis" and "epidemic."

**Saudi Arabia:** McKinsey consultants became so embedded in the Saudi government during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rise that the Planning Ministry earned the nickname "Ministry of McKinsey."

### Why Consultants Get Fired (McKinsey Data)

According to internal McKinsey sources, there are only two reasons consultants are "managed out":

1. **Analytical skills** not as strong as expected from interview (less common)
2. **Doesn't work effectively with clients** (more common)

The business is "first and foremost a relationship business." McKinsey is considered #1 "not because it has the smartest people, but because the firm has the people with the strongest relationships with clients."

**Useful as hook for:** Recording 1 (relationship management matters more than technical expertise)

## 2. Gaining Access / Business Development

### David Maister on Trust-Building

**On avoiding tricks:**
> "The trick of earning trust is to avoid all tricks."

**On emotional buying:**
> "While most providers sell on the basis of technical competence, most buyers buy on the basis of emotion."

**On what NOT to do (signs of excessive self-orientation):**
Clients recognise excessive self-orientation through: a tendency to relate their stories to ourselves, a need to too quickly finish their sentences, a need to fill empty spaces in conversations, a need to appear clever, an inability to provide a direct answer, an unwillingness to say "we don't know," name-dropping other clients, a recitation of qualifications.

**On being a fellow-voyager:**
> "We don't want people to be interested in us as a means to an end, as a destination for their own purposes. We want people to be interested in us as fellow-voyagers, people who care about us enough to go on a journey with us."

**On small touches:**
> "Advisors who rate highest on reliability will not just deliver their work on time and on spec... They will also be expert at small touches aimed at client-based familiarity—sending meeting material in advance, staying current on client events and names."

### Gerald Weinberg on Trust (from "The Secrets of Consulting")

> "The trick of earning trust is to avoid all tricks."

> "Never promise anything you're not sure you can deliver."

> "Get it in writing, but depend on trust."

## 3. Contracting and Scope

### The Hertz vs. Accenture Disaster ($32M+ Lawsuit)

**The setup:** In 2016, Hertz contracted Accenture to redesign their website and mobile app for approximately $32 million. The technology stack included Angular2, Adobe Experience Manager, MuleSoft, and integration with roughly 1,800 legacy systems. The design needed to be responsive across desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, and extensible to Hertz's other brands (Dollar and Thrifty).

**Timeline:** Originally due December 2017, postponed to January 2018, then April 2018. By June 2018—five months past deadline—Accenture had delivered nothing functional.

**What went wrong:**

1. **Contracting failure:** Hertz contracted Accenture to be the "product owner," meaning Accenture was responsible for defining scope instead of Hertz holding them accountable. "Hertz should not have abdicated ownership."

2. **RAPID technology debacle:** Accenture told Hertz to buy licenses for a technology called "RAPID" to speed up production. Hertz bought the licenses. "It turned out that Accenture didn't actually know how to use the technology and the quick-fix took longer than it would have without it."

3. **Missing requirements:** Accenture didn't implement responsive design (included in the contract). When Hertz asked about the tablet version, Accenture "demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional fees."

4. **Testing failures:** "Accenture failed to test the software, and when it did do tests they were seriously inadequate, to the point of being misleading."

5. **Ignored extensibility:** "Accenture deliberately disregarded the extensibility requirement and wrote the code so that it was specific to the Hertz brand in North America."

**The money:** After 5 months with no delivery, Accenture told Hertz it would cost an additional $10 million (on top of $32M already paid) to finish. Hertz fired Accenture and hired IBM, spending another $10M to correct or replace Accenture's work.

**Lessons for contracting:**
- Don't abdicate ownership to the consultant
- Big-name firms don't guarantee success ("well-known firms have the same success/failure rates as others, often worse")
- Unrealistic timelines cause failures—experts said 2.5-3 years was appropriate; Hertz and Accenture agreed to 18 months

### NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT) - "The Worst Contracting Fiasco"

**The setup:** The UK's National Programme for IT aimed to build a comprehensive system to manage healthcare services. Contracts were awarded to Accenture, CSC, Atos Origin, Fujitsu, and BT.

**What went wrong:** Politicians and program managers "expedited the procurement process, drawing up the contractual paperwork even before the scope was clear."

**The outcome:** Originally budgeted at £6 billion, total costs approached £12.7 billion. The government admitted the project only generated around £2.6 billion in actual benefits. The programme was dismantled in 2011.

**The verdict:** The project became known as one of "the worst and most expensive contracting fiascos" in UK public sector history.

### COVID-19 Consulting Spending

**UK Government spending:** Over £56 million on consultancy firms during the pandemic, with most contracts awarded without competition.

**The players:** Deloitte, PwC, Boston Consulting Group, and McKinsey were "working at the heart of the government's response" on track and trace, PPE procurement, and the ventilator programme.

**Daily rates:** McKinsey consultants were paid £563,000 for six weeks' work—£14,000 per day—to create a replacement for Public Health England.

## Key Quotes for All Three Topics

### Edgar Schein (from "Humble Consulting")

> "Building a relationship begins with attitudinal preparation, a conscious process of building the right kind of mind-set."

### Andrew Sobel on Advisors vs. Experts

## Ethical Dimensions

### When Consultants Should Walk Away

**Durham University identified "Being Engaged in Unnecessary Work" as a top ethical transgression:**
> "Instances where consultants take on assignments specified as vital by clients, despite feeling such projects will lead nowhere or have minimal impact. Instead of voicing such concerns or stepping back, consultants go through the motions."

*Source: [Durham University Business School - Top 5 ethical transgressions in consulting](https://www.durham.ac.uk/business/news-and-events/news/2023/april/top-5-ethical-transgressions-in-consulting/)*

**APA guidance:**
When encountering "bad actors who are not interested in honoring confidentiality," consultants should be prepared to decline the engagement.

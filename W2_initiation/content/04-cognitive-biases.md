## 4. Cognitive biases in consultancy

Understanding cognitive biases is essential for consultants, and not just because clients have them. The biases that affect how clients make decisions about hiring consultants, evaluating recommendations, and implementing change also affect how consultants themselves think about problems and solutions.

This section connects directly to what we've covered in [client relationships](#part1) (why clients respond the way they do), [gaining access](#part2) (how problem-solution dynamics are shaped by cognitive shortcuts), and [contracting](#part3) (where anchoring and framing effects influence negotiations).

### Two systems of thinking

Daniel Kahneman's research [-@kahneman2011] distinguishes two modes of thought:

:::framework
**System 1 (Fast)**
- Automatic, intuitive, effortless
- Operates on heuristics (mental shortcuts)
- Pattern recognition
- Prone to systematic errors
- Always running in the background

**System 2 (Slow)**
- Deliberate, effortful, logical
- Requires conscious attention
- Can catch System 1 errors
- Often lazy: defers to System 1
- Tires easily
:::

Most business decisions feel like System 2 work: analytical, considered, rational. But System 1 is usually driving, with System 2 rationalising afterwards.

### Biases that matter for consultancy

Four biases are particularly relevant to the topics we've covered:

**Confirmation bias**: seeking evidence that supports existing views
- Clients may have already decided what the problem is and filter your findings through that lens
- Consultants may anchor on their first diagnosis and seek confirming evidence
- *Connection to [client relationships](#part1)*: This is why powerful clients can resist consultant claims that don't fit their worldview

**Halo effect**: judging based on first impressions or reputation
- Prestigious firms get the benefit of the doubt; lesser-known consultants face scepticism regardless of substance
- A consultant who makes a good first impression may be trusted beyond their competence
- *Connection to [gaining access](#part2)*: This explains why reputation and "getting known" matter so much in business development

**Anchoring**: being influenced by initial numbers
- The first fee mentioned in a negotiation shapes all subsequent discussion
- Early problem framings constrain later thinking
- *Connection to [contracting](#part3)*: Understanding anchoring helps you manage fee negotiations and scope discussions

**Loss aversion**: fearing losses more than valuing equivalent gains
- Clients may reject beneficial changes because they focus on what they'll lose
- "This is how we've always done it" often reflects loss aversion, not analysis
- *Connection to [contracting](#part3)*: Framing recommendations in terms of "avoiding losses" vs. "achieving gains" changes how they're received

### For further exploration

We'll discuss a fuller set of biases affecting consultancy and management decision-making in the live session. For comprehensive reference on cognitive biases, see [The Decision Lab's Biases Index](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases).

### The double-edged sword

Cognitive biases aren't just obstacles; they're opportunities for effective consulting:

- **Understanding client biases** helps you frame recommendations in ways that will actually be heard
- **Understanding your own biases** helps you avoid overconfidence in your analysis
- **Understanding organisational biases** helps you design implementation approaches that work with human psychology, not against it

The goal isn't to manipulate clients through their biases. It's to recognise that neither you nor your clients are purely rational actors, and to work effectively within that reality.

:::reflect
Think about a significant decision you made recently, professional or personal. What cognitive shortcuts might have influenced your thinking? How confident are you that it was a fully "rational" choice?

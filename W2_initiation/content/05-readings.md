:::reading[core][block2011] Chapters 4, 5 and 6
Block's chapters on contracting are the heart of his practitioner approach. He treats contracting as a conversation about expectations, not just legal paperwork.

:::reading[core][sturdy2018b]
This academic article challenges simple models of how consultants and clients interact around problems and solutions. It's denser than Block but essential for understanding the critical perspective.

  <ul>
    <li>What are the three positions on the problem-solution relationship that Sturdy identifies?</li>
    <li>What does "co-construction" of problems mean in practice?</li>
    <li>How might this perspective change how you think about your own consulting or advisory work?</li>

### Why both perspectives matter

Block writes as a practitioner offering normative advice: here's how to contract effectively. Sturdy writes as an academic examining the underlying dynamics: here's what's actually happening when problems and solutions meet.

Both perspectives are valuable. Block helps you develop practical skills for managing client relationships. Sturdy helps you understand the broader context, including why some "obvious" advice doesn't work in practice.

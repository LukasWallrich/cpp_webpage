### Where do opportunities come from?

The traditional view is simple: clients have problems, consultants offer solutions. But reality is more complex. There are three models for understanding how consulting engagements begin:

:::framework
**Problem seeks solution** (demand-led)
Client identifies a problem first, then seeks consultants who can help. This is the "rational" model most often assumed.

**Solution seeks problem** (supply-push)
Consultants promote specific approaches (Six Sigma, Lean, digital transformation) and convince clients these are relevant to their situation. Critics see this as "best practice" marketing.

**Problem co-production** (interactive)
Consultant and client work together to articulate, accentuate, and adapt the problem definition. The boundary between diagnosis and solution blurs.
:::

Research suggests most consulting actually involves **co-production**, a simultaneous process where problems and solutions shape each other.

:::source[sturdy2018]
This article examines how management consultants engage with the concept of 'instrument constituencies', actors focused on promoting policy solutions rather than responding to pre-defined problems. Drawing on organisation studies research, Sturdy challenges the assumption that consultants simply chase problems to fit their ready-made solutions, revealing instead a more complex dynamic of problem-solution co-construction.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Consultants do not always construct problems to fit prepared solutions, nor do they simply respond to pre-existing client problems in the 'rational' model. Reality lies along a continuum between these positions
- Problems are often *co-produced* with clients through processes of articulation (packaging inchoate concerns), accentuation (emphasising significance through competitor comparisons) and adaptation (reframing issues to match available solutions)
- Consultants extend their market reach through 'solutions chasing solutions', repackaging existing services under new labels and diversifying into domains their tools were not designed for

**Key insight**: The relationship between consulting problems and solutions is interactive and often simultaneous rather than sequential. Understanding this co-production process is essential for analysing how consultancy shapes organisational decisions.
:::

### Clients vs. customers

Co-production depends on a particular kind of relationship. Schein draws a useful distinction:

- **Clients** want to work *with* someone to improve a situation
- **Customers** think they know what they want and seek someone to deliver it

Customers may resist diagnosis and want you to "just do it". Clients are open to exploring whether their initial framing is correct. Co-production only works with clients — those willing to engage in joint problem definition rather than simply purchasing a predefined solution.

Knowing which you're dealing with shapes how you approach the engagement and your business development more broadly. Some markets and sectors tend more toward customer mindsets; others toward client mindsets.

### Farming vs. hunting

Business development strategies fall into two broad categories:

:::framework
**Farming** (clients approach us)
- Publications: articles, books, blogs, case studies
- Presentations and media appearances
- Online presence: LinkedIn, website, thought leadership
- Reputation building and referrals
- Identifying opportunities while working with existing clients

**Hunting** (we approach clients)
- Packaging offers in response to trends and fads
- Active networking for introductions
- Responding to tenders (RFQ, RFI, RFP)
- Cold calls and direct marketing
- Mail shots and promotions
:::

Research suggests **farming** (building reputation and offering value) is more likely to succeed for most consultancies. Cold outreach tends to be less effective for professional services because trust matters too much for a cold email to create it. But hunting remains necessary—particularly when you're new, when you're expanding into new markets, or when the farming pipeline has gone quiet.

### The Pyramid of Trust

Williams [-@williams2022] argues that most consulting firms operate with a "hope strategy": they do good work and hope referrals follow. This leads to unpredictable feast-or-famine revenue cycles.

His alternative: the **Pyramid of Trust**, a systematic approach to business development.

This practitioner article presents a strategic framework for consulting firms to move beyond over-reliance on repeat business and referrals. Williams argues that most firms operate with a "hope strategy" that leads to unpredictable revenue cycles, and proposes a systematic approach to proactive business development.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Most consulting firms are "the world's best kept secret", over-reliant on referrals and repeat business, leading to feast-or-famine revenue cycles
- Effective business development requires linking discrete marketing activities into an integrated, step-by-step process
- Trust-building qualities such as clarity, proficiency, and consistency should be embedded throughout the business development process

**The Pyramid of Trust framework**: A three-stage model where consultants progress prospects through: (1) **Get Known**, reaching "Oblivious" audiences through broad channels like LinkedIn and networking; (2) **Build Trust**, engaging "Afflicted" audiences who recognise their challenges through deeper content such as blogs, newsletters, and lead magnets; (3) **Generate Leads**, converting "Informed" audiences through intimate interactions like webinars, executive dinners, or free training, ultimately shifting from one-to-many to one-to-one conversations.

**Key insight**: Sustainable consulting growth requires systematically nurturing prospects through increasing levels of trust and engagement, rather than hoping for referrals.

Think about how you've found work opportunities in the past. Were you farming or hunting? What would it take to be more systematic about building trust with potential clients?

- Prepare notes on the discussion questions below
:::

### Discussion questions

Reflect on these questions and bring your notes to the live session:

1. **What key issues most influence consultant-client relationships?** Drawing on the readings and your own experience, what factors determine whether a consultant-client relationship works well or poorly?

2. **What are your top-3 priorities for contracting?** Based on Block's approach and your own experience, what should consultants focus on when establishing engagements?

3. **Demand-led or supply-push?** From your own experience of consultancy, are consultants more in the business of responding to client problems or promoting predetermined solutions?

### Live session focus

The live session will be discussion-based rather than additional lecture. We'll explore:

- **Relationship dynamics**: What makes consultant-client relationships work? What destroys them?
- **Problem-solution tensions**: How do you balance genuine diagnosis with the solutions you know how to deliver?
- **Contracting challenges**: What are the hardest conversations to have early in an engagement?
- **Cognitive biases**: How do biases affect both consultants and clients?

### Assignment connection

As you work through this week's materials, start thinking about your assignment context:

- What kind of consultant do you want to be in the assignment?
- How would you approach the client relationship?
- What contracting conversations would be essential?

Read the assignment brief and some examples on Moodle if you haven't already.

### Looking ahead

Next week we begin the **diagnosis** phase of the consultancy cycle: how consultants gather information, analyse situations, and develop understanding of the problems they're addressing.

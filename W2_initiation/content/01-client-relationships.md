Part 1: Client-consultant relationships 
- The partnership rhetoric vs. messy reality
- Power dynamics: who really holds the cards?
- Why relationship management matters as much as technical expertise
- Who's got the monkey? Managing task ownership
- Different contexts require different approaches

### The partnership ideal

Consultancies promote collaborative relationships. PwC, for instance, emphasises putting themselves "in their clients' shoes" and measuring how they perform against client expectations. The language is all about partnership, collaboration, and mutual benefit.

But academic research reveals a more complex picture.

### How the literature frames consultants

In much of the critical literature, consultants appear as:

- **Outsiders** bringing in new ideas
- **Knowledge entrepreneurs** developing "ambiguous, yet attractive products and services for consumption"
- **Legitimisers** providing objective validation for internal ideas
- **Heroes** saving struggling organisations

These framings share an assumption: that consultants *do something to* clients. But Sturdy [-@sturdy2018b] argues this overstates consultant influence while underestimating client agency.

:::source[sturdy2018b]
This article examines how consultants relate to client problems and solutions, drawing on the concept of 'instrument constituencies' from policy studies. Sturdy challenges both the rational model (consultants respond to pre-existing problems) and the cynical view (consultants manipulate clients into buying predetermined solutions). Instead, he identifies a third position: problems and solutions are often *co-constructed* simultaneously by consultants and clients together.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Consultants don't simply respond to client-defined problems; they help articulate, accentuate, and adapt problems in ways that fit available solutions
- This co-construction combines 'supply push' (promoting solutions) with 'demand led' (responding to problems) approaches
- Problem definition is often contested and negotiated, particularly with the growing role of procurement departments
- Consultants also extend solutions to new domains through 'diversification' – repackaging existing tools for new problem areas

**Key insight**: The relationship between problems and solutions in consultancy exists on a continuum: from problems pre-dating solutions (rational model), to problems and solutions being co-produced simultaneously (co-construction), to solutions preceding problems (problem chasing). Most consulting practice falls somewhere in the middle.

### Reality is more dynamic

Client organisations are highly active participants. They adapt "recipes from cookbooks to suit their own tastes" rather than passively consuming consultant advice. The boundaries between consultants and client management blur through personal relationships, prior work experiences, and the simple fact that consultants become organisational actors the moment they enter.

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/J Management Studies - 2002 - Fincham - The Consultant Client Relationship  Critical Perspectives on the Management of.pdf -->
:::source[fincham1999]
This influential article examines how consultants and clients interact during organisational change, contrasting two critical perspectives: a 'strategic' view emphasising consultants' persuasive and symbolic strategies, and a 'structural' view highlighting external constraints on consultancy. Fincham argues these perspectives are complementary rather than opposed, and that the consultant–client relationship should be understood as contingent and open-ended rather than following fixed patterns of dependency.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Consultants lack codified professional knowledge, making legitimisation through symbolic strategies (performance, rhetoric, impression management) central to their success
- Client organisations are not passive consumers of advice; powerful clients can resist consultant claims and construct rival versions of expertise, particularly when they possess strong operational knowledge
- The relationship is best understood as a market exchange within a broader managerial structure, with the balance of power shaped by contingent factors such as client market position and technical sophistication

**Key insight**: There is no 'necessary' structure to the consultant–client relationship. It can range from client dependency to consultant vulnerability to genuine interdependency, depending on the relative knowledge and market power each party brings.

### Relationship management priorities

Karantinou and Hogg [-@karantinou2001] identify key characteristics of consultant-client relationships:

- **Information asymmetry**: consultants know their methods; clients know their organisation
- **Ambiguous power balances**: neither side has complete control
- **Value conflicts**: efficiency vs. buy-in, speed vs. thoroughness

Their research suggests two priorities for consultants:
1. **Identify shared values and maintain trust**: without trust, technical expertise counts for little
2. **Keep appropriate distance**: closeness builds trust, but too much closeness compromises independence

Consultancy often becomes "personified in an individual": clients purchase "knowledge and creativity embodied in individuals" rather than the firm's brand. This makes relationship management intensely personal.

### Remember the four roles

From Week 1, recall the four consultant archetypes:

- **Plumber**: brought in as expert pair-of-hands to solve problems with expertise
- **Doctor**: diagnoses issues and prescribes solutions
- **Advisor**: strategic partner supporting problem-solving while client retains ownership
- **Navigator**: guides client towards agreed solutions through change management

The role you *think* you're playing may differ from what the client expects. Clarifying this early prevents frustration on both sides.

### Who's got the monkey?

Oncken and Wass's classic HBR article [-@oncken1974] explains how managers get bogged down: subordinates pass them the "monkey" (the next move in a task), then wait for it to be returned. The same dynamic occurs in consultancy.

Sometimes passing the monkey to the consultant is appropriate; that's what they're paid for. But effective consultants are conscious of monkey management: are you taking on problems you shouldn't? Are clients abdicating ownership they need to retain?

### Different contexts: public sector

Radnor and O'Mahoney [-@radnor2013] examined the growth of public sector consulting in the 21st century. They found:

- Different organisational culture requires different packaging
- Public sector clients are often less familiar with process management thinking
- Greater risk aversion means less willingness to experiment
- Procurement plays a larger role, favouring simpler and cheaper "products"

The takeaway: effective relationship management requires understanding your client's context, not just their stated problem.

Think about a professional relationship where you've worked with someone who had expertise you lacked. How did power dynamics play out? What built or eroded trust?

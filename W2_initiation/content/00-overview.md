### How to use these materials

To prepare for the live session, you should:

1. **Watch the recordings** for each section (Parts 1-3, ~55 minutes total), and skim the written content that highlights key points
2. **Complete the core readings**: Block [-@block2011] Chapters 4-6 and Sturdy [-@sturdy2018b]
3. **Read the cognitive biases section** (written content, no video)
4. **Work through the preparation checklist** at the end

The expandable academic source summaries throughout these materials are **optional enrichment**. They provide deeper context if you're interested, but aren't essential for the live session.

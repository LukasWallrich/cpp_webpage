Part 3: Contracting and scoping 
- Why contracting matters beyond the legal paperwork
- Block's ground rules for effective contracts
- Knowing your client stakeholders
- Navigating organisational politics
:::

### Why think about contracting?

Contracting is more than legal paperwork. Done well, it:

- Develops a **joint perspective** on the problem to be addressed
- Outlines **responsibility and scope** consultants take on (avoiding "mission creep")
- Establishes **shared criteria for success**
- Sets up the **desired working relationship**
- Agrees budget, timeline, and resourcing

A contract is a conversation about expectations. If that conversation doesn't happen clearly, problems follow.

### Block's ground rules

Peter Block [-@block2011] offers principles for effective contracting:

:::framework
**50/50 responsibility**
Both consultant and client share responsibility for success. If the consultant owns everything, the client has no stake. If the client owns everything, why are you there?

**Freely entered**
Ideally all relevant parties should willingly participate. Contracts imposed on reluctant participants rarely succeed.

**Direct contact with all contract parties**
Don't rely on intermediaries. If the sponsor's priorities differ from your main contact's, you need to know that directly.

**All "wants" are legitimate**
Contract for behaviour, not beliefs. You can't make someone want what you want, but you can agree what each party will *do*.

**Boundaries: saying "No"**
Knowing what you won't do is as important as knowing what you will. Scope creep kills projects.

**Write things down**
And adapt as necessary. A living document beats a perfect one that sits in a drawer.

### Know your client stakeholders

Block's principle of "direct contact with all contract parties" raises a question: who *are* those parties? Different stakeholders play different roles in consulting engagements:

- **Initial contacts and gatekeepers**: the people who first hear about you and decide whether to let you in
- **Main clients** (principal collaborators): the people you'll work with day-to-day
- **Contracting clients**: those involved in the purchasing decision, often including procurement
- **Sponsoring clients**: senior management who own the initiative and its outcomes

Each requires different communication and different value propositions. Your day-to-day contact may care about practical delivery; the sponsor may care about strategic outcomes; procurement may care about risk and compliance. Understanding these distinctions early helps you navigate the contracting conversation effectively.

### Good practices for contracting

Practical guidance for early conversations:

1. **Ask direct questions and elicit expectations**: don't assume you know what the client wants—they may not have fully articulated it themselves, and your job is to help them clarify
2. **State your understanding explicitly**: "Here's how I see the situation. Here's what I'd need to succeed." Be direct about your perspective, not just a passive listener
3. **Probe concerns**: unspoken worries become problems later—if someone seems sceptical, draw it out now rather than discovering it through passive resistance months in
4. **Say no, or postpone**, if success is not sufficiently likely: taking an engagement set up to fail hurts your reputation more than passing on it
5. **Be willing to recommend better approaches**, even if it means recommending a competitor—clients remember honesty, and the work you turn down often leads to better-fitting work later

Your assessment will change as the problem definition evolves. That's fine; the contract should be a living document. What matters is maintaining honest dialogue throughout.

### Practical issues to address early

Randall et al. [-@randall2019] suggest checking during initial meetings:

- **Job titles and sensitivities**: get an org chart if you can—who reports to whom? Who has real authority versus formal authority? Where are the political tensions?
- **Potential budget parameters**: not to anchor on a number, but to understand the scale—are they imagining a £50,000 project or a £500,000 one? That shapes everything
- **Previous experience with change**: what did they like about past initiatives? What went wrong? This tells you about their expectations—and where their scar tissue is. If they had a bad experience with consultants before, you need to know that
- **What they're really looking for**: not deliverables, but *outcomes*—a report isn't an outcome; improved efficiency, reduced conflict, clearer strategy are outcomes
- **Whether these goals make sense**: retain your independence—if they're asking for something that won't solve their actual problem, say so. That's why they're hiring you

Summarise and test key themes you've heard: "So what I'm hearing is..." Make sure you're actually aligned before moving forward. Don't rush past these practicalities—they reveal the real situation beneath the presenting problem.

### Watch out for organisational politics

Biggs [-@biggs2010] maps the antecedents of organisational politics:

**Organisational factors that breed politics:**
- Organisational change and ambiguous goals
- Shortage of resources
- New technology or environmental changes
- Unclear performance evaluation
- Role ambiguity

**Individual factors:**
- Desire for control
- Perceived threats to status or power
- Low trust environments

**How politics manifests:**
- Controlling information and lines of communication
- Coalition building
- Selective use of objective criteria
- Managing impressions

As a consultant, you enter this political landscape. Awareness doesn't mean manipulation; it means knowing where the landmines are.

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/Bridging_Uncertainty.pdf -->
:::source[gluckler2003]
This foundational article examines how management consulting markets operate under conditions of high uncertainty. The authors argue that because consulting lacks professional standards, clear industry boundaries, and measurable quality indicators, competition operates on fundamentally different grounds than in other sectors.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Two types of uncertainty characterise consulting: *institutional uncertainty* (lack of professional standards, blurred industry boundaries, no product standards) and *transactional uncertainty* (confidentiality risks, service intangibility, interdependent co-production)
- Clients select consultants through a four-stage hierarchy: (1) public reputation segments the market into strata, (2) experience-based trust guides choices among known firms, (3) 'networked reputation' (word-of-mouth through trusted business contacts) determines decisions when direct experience is lacking, and (4) price matters only after uncertainty is resolved
- Networked reputation reconciles the trade-off between market scope (accessing many potential consultants) and certainty (trusting the choice), making it the key driver of consulting firm growth

**Key insight**: In consulting, your network is your market - a firm's reputation within trusted business relationships matters far more than price or measurable quality for winning new clients.

Think about a contract or agreement that went wrong, professional or personal. What wasn't discussed that should have been? What would you do differently?

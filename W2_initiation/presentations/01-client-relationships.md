# Recording 1: Client-Consultant Relationships

**Duration:** ~8 minutes
**Slides:** 1-11
**Core message:** The consultant-client relationship is neither partnership nor dominance. It's a dynamic negotiation shaped by context, power, and trust.

## Slide 1: Title

**Visual:** Title slide with module name

> "Clients & Contracting"

**Story to tell:**
Here's a scenario. You're brought in as a strategic advisor to help a leadership team rethink their operating model. Three weeks in, you realise they've already decided what they want to do—they just need you to validate it. Are you still an advisor? Or have you become something else?

This week we're looking at how consulting relationships actually work: the gap between what firms *say* these relationships are and what they turn out to be in practice.

## Slide 2: Starting the Consultancy Cycle

**Visual:** The consultancy cycle diagram with "Initial contact" and "Contracting" highlighted

**Story to tell:**
We're at the beginning of the cycle—initial contact and contracting. But here's the thing: this isn't just about getting a signature on a document. The dynamics you establish in these early conversations shape everything that follows. Get them wrong, and you'll be fighting the consequences for months - and the team that comes in with you will inherit those problems.

**Key insight:**
The relationship is set before the work begins. Pay attention to how it's being framed from day one.

## Slide 4: The Partnership Rhetoric

**Visual:** PwC quote about "putting ourselves in our clients' shoes"

**Story to tell:**
This is from PwC's website. Notice the language: partnership, collaboration, walking in their shoes, measuring against expectations. It sounds warm, almost intimate.

Every large consultancy talks this way. McKinsey's "trusted advisor". BCG's "partnership" framing. The rhetoric is universal—and it's not accidental. These firms know that clients prefer to think they're buying a collaborative relationship rather than a service.

But here's what I want you to think about: when have you experienced a professional relationship that *genuinely* matched this rhetoric? And when did the reality fall short?

**Key insight:**
The question isn't whether partnership is a nice ideal. It's whether this framing holds up in practice - and whether it aligns with the incentives of both parties. Academic research suggests it's more complicated than the marketing implies.

## Slide 5: How Literature Frames Consultants

**Visual:** Bullet points showing consultant framings: outsiders, knowledge entrepreneurs, legitimisers, heroes

**Story to tell:**
Now let's look at how the academic literature frames consultants. These framings come from more critical research:

- *Outsiders* bringing fresh perspectives
- *Knowledge entrepreneurs* developing what one researcher calls "ambiguous, yet attractive products"
- *Legitimisers* providing external validation for decisions already made
- *Heroes* rescuing struggling organisations

Notice what these have in common: they all assume the consultant *does something to* the client. The consultant acts; the client receives.

**Key insight:**
This framing has a blind spot. It overstates consultant influence and ignores client agency. Clients aren't passive consumers—and the written content explores exactly how they push back.

## Slide 6: Reality is More Complex

**Visual:** Sturdy et al. quote about clients adapting "recipes from cookbooks to suit their own tastes"

**Story to tell:**
Andrew Sturdy's research paints a different picture. Clients are "highly active" participants who adapt consultant advice like "recipes from cookbooks to suit their own tastes."

Think about what that means in practice. You deliver a recommendation. The client doesn't just accept or reject it—they reshape it, blend it with their own ideas, filter it through their politics, and implement something that's partly yours and partly theirs. The final outcome may look quite different from what you proposed.

And something else happens: boundaries blur. You work alongside client staff for months. Personal relationships develop. You become embedded in the organisation's dynamics.

**Key insight:**
The moment you walk through the door, you become an organisational actor. You're inside, not outside—with all the opportunities and complications that brings.

**Go deeper:** The Fincham source block in the written materials explores three distinct scenarios for consultant-client power dynamics. Worth reading to see when consultant expertise wins out and when powerful clients can completely reshape the engagement.

## Slide 7: Relationship Management Priorities

**Visual:** Framework showing information asymmetry, ambiguous power, value conflicts; priorities of trust and distance

**Story to tell:**
Karantinou and Hogg studied what makes professional service relationships difficult. They found three persistent tensions:

First, *information asymmetry*. You know your methods; they know their organisation. Neither side sees the full picture.

Second, *ambiguous power*. Who's actually in charge? Neither side fully controls the outcome.

Third, *value conflicts*. You might prioritise efficiency; they might prioritise avoiding risks. You want speed; they need consensus.

Given these tensions, two priorities emerge: build trust, but maintain enough distance to stay independent. Get too close and you lose your outsider perspective—you become captured by the client's way of seeing things. Stay too distant and you can't build the trust needed to influence anything.

**Key insight:**
Here's what makes this personal: consultancy becomes "personified in an individual." Clients don't buy McKinsey or PwC (and even less smaller brands) — they buy *you*. Your relationship management skills matter as much as your technical expertise.

## Slide 8: Remember the Four Roles

**Visual:** Four archetypes: Plumber, Doctor, Advisor, Navigator

**Story to tell:**
Quick reminder from last week: Plumber, Doctor, Advisor, Navigator. Four ways of framing what a consultant does.

Why does this matter for relationships? Because role misalignment is one of the fastest ways to damage trust.

Imagine you walk in thinking you're an Advisor—a strategic partner helping the client think through options. But the client sees you as a Plumber: an expert pair of hands to execute something they've already decided. You'll spend the whole engagement talking past each other.

Or you're in Doctor mode, wanting to diagnose the problem properly. But they've already diagnosed it and just want implementation support. Every diagnostic question feels like you're second-guessing them.

**Key insight:**
Clarify roles early and explicitly. Ask: "What do you see as my role in this?" The answer might surprise you.

**Go deeper:** The written content links role clarity to the Fincham research—how power dynamics can flip your expected role entirely.

## Slide 9: Who's Got the Monkey?

**Visual:** Reference to Oncken & Wass HBR article

**Story to tell:**
This concept comes from a classic Harvard Business Review article from the 1970s—but it's still remarkably useful.

The "monkey" is the next move. Whoever has the monkey has to act before anything else happens.

Here's the dynamic: a client describes a problem. You say "let me think about that and get back to you." Congratulations—you now have the monkey. The client waits. You're the one who has to move next.

Sometimes that's exactly right; problem-solving is what you're paid for. But sometimes clients pass you monkeys they need to keep. They want you to make decisions that are really theirs. They want to abdicate ownership of difficult choices.

**Key insight:**
Pay attention to monkey movement. When someone hands you a monkey, ask: should this monkey be with me, or should it stay with them? Healthy consulting relationships involve passing monkeys back and forth—not accumulating them all on one side.

## Slide 10: Different Contexts: Public Sector

**Visual:** Points about public sector consulting growth and differences

**Story to tell:**
One more dimension: context matters. Everything we've discussed shifts depending on the setting.

Radnor and O'Mahoney examined consulting in the public sector, which has grown massively this century. What they found: different context, different dynamics.

Public sector clients are often less familiar with process management approaches that consultants take for granted. They're more risk-averse—understandably, given the political consequences of visible failures. Procurement plays a much larger role, which pushes toward standardised, comparable products rather than bespoke solutions.

**Key insight:**
An NHS trust isn't Goldman Sachs. A local council isn't a tech startup. Relationship management starts with understanding your client's world—their constraints, their culture, their definition of success.

**Bridge:**
That's the relationship side. Next recording: how do consulting opportunities arise in the first place? It's not always "client has problem, calls consultant." Sometimes consultants create the problem. We'll look at farming versus hunting, and a framework called the Pyramid of Trust.

**Reflection prompt:** Before moving on, think about a professional relationship where the other party didn't understand your context—your constraints, your pressures. How did that affect the dynamic?

# Recording 2: Gaining Access

**Duration:** ~7 minutes
**Slides:** 1-5 (in this deck, originally slides 12-16)
**Core message:** Business development isn't just sales. It's about understanding where opportunities come from and systematically building trust.

## Slide 1: Agenda (Section Transition)

**Visual:** Agenda with "Creating opportunities & gaining access" highlighted

**Story to tell:**
Here's a question to start with: Think of the last time you convinced someone they had a problem they didn't know they had. Maybe you noticed something in their work and pointed it out. Maybe you described a risk they hadn't considered.

That's one way consulting engagements begin—and it complicates the simple story that clients have problems and consultants solve them.

This section explores where consulting opportunities actually come from, and how consultants systematically create them.

## Slide 2: Where Do Opportunities Come From?

**Visual:** Three models: Problem seeks solution, Solution seeks problem, Problem co-production

**Story to tell:**
Three models for how consulting engagements begin.

**Model 1: Problem seeks solution.** This is the traditional view. Client has a problem, searches for someone who can help, finds a consultant. Demand-led, rational, straightforward.

**Model 2: Solution seeks problem.** More controversial. Consultants develop approaches—Six Sigma, digital transformation, agile methodology, whatever the current trend is—and then convince clients these are relevant to them. The solution exists before the problem is identified. Critics call this "best-practice marketing."

**Model 3: Problem co-production.** This is more subtle. The problem isn't fully defined when the engagement starts. Consultant and client work together to figure out what the problem actually is. The problem emerges from the conversation—shaped partly by what solutions are available.

**Key insight:**
Research suggests most consulting actually involves co-production. You can't cleanly separate diagnosis from prescription. How you frame the problem shapes what solutions look viable; what solutions you know about shapes how you frame the problem.

**Go deeper:** The Sturdy source block in the written content breaks down this co-production process into three mechanisms: articulation, accentuation, and adaptation. Worth understanding if you want to see how consultants and clients construct problems together.

## Slide 3: Farming vs. Hunting

**Visual:** Split diagram. Farming (clients approach us): publications, presentations, reputation → referrals, repeat business. Hunting (we approach clients): networking, tenders, cold outreach.

**Story to tell:**
Now let's talk about how consultants actually find work. Two broad approaches: farming and hunting.

**Farming:** You plant seeds and cultivate relationships over time. Writing, speaking, building your online presence. Eventually, clients come to you—through referrals, or because your reputation precedes you. The best source of new work is often existing work: opportunities you spot while already working with a client.

**Hunting:** You go out and pursue opportunities directly. Active networking, responding to tenders, and at the harder end—cold outreach.

**Key insight:**
Research suggests farming is more likely to succeed for most consultancies. Cold outreach tends to be less effective because trust matters too much for a cold email to create it. But hunting remains necessary—particularly when you're new, expanding into new markets, or when the farming pipeline has gone quiet.

The danger Williams identifies: becoming "the world's best kept secret"—doing excellent work but having no systematic approach to making that known. That leads to feast-or-famine revenue cycles. The Pyramid of Trust addresses this.

## Slide 4: The Pyramid of Trust

**Visual:** Williams' Pyramid of Trust framework

**Story to tell:**
Martin Williams offers a framework that brings structure to business development: the Pyramid of Trust.

His observation: most consulting firms operate with a "hope strategy." Do good work, hope referrals follow. When they do—feast. When they don't—famine. Revenue cycles are unpredictable because there's no systematic approach.

His alternative: move prospects through three stages deliberately.

**Stage 1: Get Known.** These are "oblivious" audiences—they don't know you exist, don't know they have a problem. Broad channels: LinkedIn, networking events, thought leadership content. You're just trying to get on their radar.

**Stage 2: Build Trust.** Now you're reaching "afflicted" audiences—they recognise they have challenges but aren't ready to buy. Deeper engagement: newsletters, blogs, lead magnets, content that demonstrates genuine expertise.

**Stage 3: Generate Leads.** "Informed" audiences who are ready. Intimate interactions: webinars, executive roundtables, one-to-one conversations. Moving from one-to-many to one-to-one.

**Key insight:**
The framework's value is in linking these activities into an integrated process—not treating them as disconnected marketing tactics. Each stage feeds the next.

**Go deeper:** The Williams source block in the written content explains how to embed trust-building qualities throughout this process. Worth reading if you want to apply this systematically.

## Slide 5: Clients vs. Customers

**Visual:** Two types: Clients (work with you) vs Customers (want delivery)

**Story to tell:**
One more distinction before we move on—this comes from Edgar Schein, and it connects back to what we said about co-production.

*Clients* want to work with you to improve a situation. They're open to exploring whether their initial framing is right. *Customers* think they already know what they want; they just need you to deliver it.

Why does this matter? Co-production—that joint problem definition we discussed earlier—only works with clients. If someone has a fixed idea of what they want and isn't open to diagnosis, you can't co-produce the problem. You're just delivering a specification.

Knowing which you're dealing with shapes how you approach the engagement.

**Bridge:**
Now you've gained access. Someone's interested. Next: how do you turn that interest into a clear agreement about what you'll actually do? That's contracting—and it's more than getting a signature. We'll also look at the different stakeholders you need to navigate in that process.

**Reflection prompt:** Think about how you've found work opportunities in the past. Were you farming or hunting? What would it take to be more systematic?

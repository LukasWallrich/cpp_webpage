# Recording 3: Contracting and Scoping

**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Slides:** 1-5 (in this deck, originally slides 19-23)
**Core message:** Contracting is a conversation about expectations, not just legal paperwork. Getting it right here prevents problems later.

## Slide 1: Agenda (Section Transition)

**Visual:** Agenda with "Contracting & scoping" highlighted

**Story to tell:**
Every consultant has a horror story about a contract that went wrong. Usually, if you trace it back, it started with a conversation that didn't happen clearly enough in week one.

Someone assumed they were buying strategic advice when you thought you were delivering a fixed report. Someone expected to be consulted on every decision; you thought they'd delegated authority to you. Someone thought the budget was flexible; you thought it was fixed.

This section is about those early conversations—and why getting them right matters more than the paperwork that follows.

## Slide 2: Why Think About Contracting?

**Visual:** Bullet points on purposes of contracting

**Story to tell:**
Let's be clear: contracting isn't just getting a signature on a legal document. That's the easy part. The hard part is the conversation that should precede it.

What does that conversation need to achieve?

**First:** Develop a joint perspective on the problem. You and the client need to agree on what you're actually trying to solve. This sounds obvious—but disagreements here are often hidden. You discover them halfway through when expectations collide.

**Second:** Outline responsibility and scope. What are you taking on? What *isn't* your responsibility? Without this clarity, scope creep is inevitable. Every project drifts unless you explicitly bound it.

**Third:** Establish shared criteria for success. How will you know if this worked? If you can't agree upfront, you'll argue about it later. And be clear: success means *outcomes*, not deliverables. A report isn't success; improved efficiency or clearer strategy is.

**Fourth:** Set up the working relationship. How will you communicate? Who makes decisions? What access do you need?

And yes, **budget, timeline, resources**—the practical stuff that everyone focuses on. But notice: that's last on the list, not first.

**Key insight:**
The contract is a conversation about expectations. If that conversation doesn't happen clearly, problems are just delayed, not avoided.

## Slide 3: Block's Ground Rules

**Visual:** List of Block's contracting principles

**Story to tell:**
Peter Block's *Flawless Consulting* is one of the foundational texts in this field. He offers six principles for contracting that sound simple but aren't easy.

**Fifty-fifty responsibility.** Both you and the client share ownership of success. If you own everything, the client has no stake—they'll wait passively for you to fix things. If they own everything, why are you there?

**Freely entered.** All relevant parties should willingly participate. This sounds obvious until you're brought in to fix a department whose manager didn't ask for you—and resents your presence. Contracts imposed on reluctant participants rarely succeed.

**Direct contact with all contract parties.** Don't rely on intermediaries to tell you what the sponsor wants. If their priorities differ from your day-to-day contact's, you need to know that directly.

**All "wants" are legitimate.** You contract for behaviour, not beliefs. You can't make someone want what you want. But you can agree on what each party will *do*.

**Boundaries—saying no.** Knowing what you won't do is as important as knowing what you will. The consultant who agrees to everything achieves nothing.

**Write things down.** And adapt as necessary. A living document beats a perfect one that sits in a drawer.

**Key insight:**
Most contracting failures can be traced back to skipping one of these principles. They're your checklist for difficult conversations.

**Go deeper:** Block's book is your core reading this week—Chapters 4-6 develop these principles in detail with worked examples.

## Slide 4: Know Your Stakeholders

**Visual:** Different stakeholder types: gatekeepers, main clients, contracting clients, sponsors

**Story to tell:**
That principle about "direct contact with all contract parties" raises a question: who *are* those parties?

Different stakeholders play different roles in consulting engagements:

- **Gatekeepers and initial contacts:** The people who first hear about you and decide whether you get further
- **Main clients:** Who you'll work with day-to-day—they care about whether you're easy to work with
- **Contracting clients:** Those involved in the purchasing decision, often including procurement—they care about compliance and value
- **Sponsoring clients:** Senior management who own the initiative—they care about strategic outcomes

The sponsor asks "will this work?" Procurement asks "is this good value?" Your day-to-day contact asks "can I work with this person?" Same engagement, different concerns.

One practical tip: get an org chart early if you can. Pay attention to who has real authority versus formal authority—they're not always the same. Understanding these distinctions helps you navigate the contracting conversation.

## Slide 5: Navigating Organisational Politics

**Visual:** Biggs' model of organisational politics antecedents

**Story to tell:**
Final point—and this one's easy to overlook: you're entering a political landscape whether you like it or not.

Biggs identifies conditions that breed organisational politics:
- **Organisational change:** When things are in flux, people protect their positions
- **Ambiguous goals:** When success isn't clearly defined, people define it to favour themselves
- **Resource scarcity:** When there's not enough to go around, people compete
- **Low trust:** When people don't trust each other, they play defensive games

Individual factors matter too: desire for control, threats to status, existing power dynamics.

How does this show up? Controlling information. Controlling who talks to whom. Building coalitions. Using "objective" criteria selectively. Managing impressions carefully.

**Key insight:**
As a consultant, you enter this terrain. Awareness isn't about becoming manipulative—it's about knowing where the landmines are so you can navigate without stepping on them. Some of the resistance you'll face won't be about your analysis or recommendations at all. It'll be about politics.

**Go deeper:** The written content on cognitive biases explains *why* people play these games. Loss aversion and confirmation bias are often at the root of political behaviour. Understanding the psychology makes the politics less mysterious.

**Closing:**
That's contracting—and that's the three video recordings done.

What we haven't covered in video form is cognitive biases: confirmation bias, the halo effect, anchoring, loss aversion. That's written content for you to read before the live session. These biases affect both consultants and clients—understanding them helps explain why the dynamics we've discussed play out the way they do.

See you in the live session, where we'll work through how these pieces fit together.

**Reflection prompt:** Think about a time when you entered an unfamiliar political landscape—a new job, a new team, a new client. What signals helped you understand the dynamics? What did you miss?

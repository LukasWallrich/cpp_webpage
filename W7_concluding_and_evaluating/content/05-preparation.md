### Discussion questions

Reflect on these questions and bring your notes to the live session:

1. **During evaluation, closure and commodification, what ethical challenges need to be navigated?** Consider the Figgie International case: who bears responsibility when things go wrong? What should consultants do when they see warning signs?

2. **When thinking about your assignment area, what are opportunities and risks of commodification?** What aspects of your approach could be packaged for reuse? What would be lost if you tried to standardise it?

3. **If you have experience with consultancy engagements (as consultant or client), what made handovers successful or less so?** What factors distinguished good endings from poor ones?

4. **How should consultants balance the need to demonstrate success with the need to learn from failure?** Given the political pressures around evaluation, how can honest learning occur?

5. **What success criteria would you propose for your assignment?** How would you know if your recommendations had been effective? What would you measure, and when?

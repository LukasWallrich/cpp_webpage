Part 2: Planning for positive disengagement
- Why endings carry disproportionate weight
- Signals that it's time to disengage
- Why handovers fail, and what the research says
- Creating closure opportunities
- The emotional dimension of endings
:::

### Why closure matters

:::summary
How you end an engagement shapes the client's lasting impression, the likelihood of repeat business, and whether changes stick. **A poor ending can undo good work**.
:::

Recall from Week 2: most consulting work comes from existing clients or referrals. Cockman, Evans & Reynolds [-@cockman1999] emphasise that acting professionally throughout the engagement, including its conclusion, is essential for building trust and maintaining reputation. The final interactions often carry disproportionate weight in how clients remember the whole experience.

### When to say goodbye

:::summary
Several signals indicate it's time to disengage. The ideal ending comes when the **client is ready to continue without you**: knowledge transferred, capabilities developed, systems in place.
:::

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Objectives achieved | The contracted work is complete |
| Client capability built | They can now do this themselves |
| Diminishing returns | Your value-add is declining |
| Relationship strain | Continued presence creates problems |
| Budget exhausted | Resources allocated are spent |

The client should feel confident, not abandoned. Block [-@block2011] argues that consultants should aim to work themselves out of a job. If the client remains dependent on you, you haven't succeeded, regardless of how much revenue dependency generates.

### Making handovers successful

The video covers the key insight from the APM research: handover fails when treated as an afterthought. The framework below provides the full set of 12 recommendations for reference.

:::framework
**APM Research [-@apm2017]** identifies 12 recommendations for successful handover in four categories:

**Commercial/Contractual**
1. Design handover into contracts from the start
2. Align incentives for effective knowledge transfer
3. Budget adequately for handover activities

**Process**
4. Plan handover as a process, not an event
5. Start handover activities early in the project
6. Use formal handover checkpoints and reviews

**Data/Knowledge Transfer**
7. Document decisions, not just deliverables
8. Transfer tacit knowledge through shadowing and coaching
9. Ensure data is accessible and understandable

**People**
10. Identify and prepare receiving team early
11. Build relationships between project and operational teams
12. Allow overlap periods for questions and support

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/apm2017.pdf -->
:::source[apm2017]
This APM Research Fund report examines why project handovers often fail and provides practical guidance based on 18 interviews with practitioners across sectors including Crossrail, Transport for London, and AWE/Ministry of Defence.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Handover should be understood as a **transition process, not a date**. The tendency to treat it as a single point in time puts benefits realisation at risk
- Successful projects had clear, measurable benefits communicated to all stakeholders from the outset (85% agreement in survey)
- End users must be involved throughout the project lifecycle, not just brought in at the end to "receive" the output (75% agreement)
- Knowledge transfer requires phased delivery. Training crammed into a brief period before handover yields poor results
- Documentation must be meaningful to end users, not a "data dump in the easiest method possible for the supply chain"

**Key insight**: Handover fails when treated as an afterthought. It must be planned from project initiation, with the client prepared for the organisational changes required to realise benefits.
:::

The research found that handover often fails because it's treated as an afterthought, a final activity to rush through before moving to the next project. Successful handovers are **planned from the start** and **resourced adequately**.

### Through preparation

The following sections go beyond the video with practical detail on handover planning.

Effective handover requires preparation throughout the engagement:

**Skills transfer**: Build client capability as you work, not just at the end. This means:
- Working alongside client staff rather than separately
- Explaining your methods, not just your conclusions
- Creating documentation that enables future maintenance

**Support plans**: Agree what ongoing support (if any) will be available after disengagement:
- Who can the client contact with questions?
- What level of support is included vs. chargeable?
- For how long will support be available?

### Resourcing and creating closure

:::summary
Handover requires **time** — organisations have limited **change capacity** [-@meyerstensaker2006] to absorb new ways of working. Block [-@block2011] Chapter 21 emphasises that disengagement should also create opportunities for **project reviews**, **feedback in both directions**, and **team celebrations**.
:::

If you've spent months developing a solution, don't expect the client to absorb it in a single handover meeting. Common resourcing failures:

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| No overlap period | Client has questions with nobody to ask |
| Single handover meeting | Too much information, nothing retained |
| Documentation only | Tacit knowledge not transferred |
| Wrong people in handover | Decision-makers absent, implementers overwhelmed |

**Project reviews** should involve the client sponsor, key stakeholders, and project team members in frank discussion of challenges as well as successes.

**Feedback in both directions**:
- What did the client value most (and least) about the engagement?
- What could the consultant have done differently?
- What has the consultant learned from this client?

**Team celebrations** matter too: acknowledging completion, recognising contributions, marking the end of relationships formed during the work. Even if the project had difficulties, closure rituals matter.

### The emotional dimension of endings

Endings involve emotions, for consultants and clients alike. Long engagements create working relationships; conclusions involve loss as well as achievement.

Acknowledging this human dimension matters:
- Allow time for proper goodbyes
- Express appreciation genuinely
- Don't rush the ending just because "the work is done"
- Recognise that clients may have mixed feelings about your departure

:::reflect
Think about a project or job that ended well. What made the ending feel complete and satisfying? What about one that ended poorly? What was missing?

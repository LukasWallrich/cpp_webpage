## Readings

Complete these readings *before* the live session. The questions below are designed to guide your reading; you don't need to write up formal answers, but come prepared to discuss.

:::reading[core][block2011] Chapter 21
Block's chapter on getting the contract and project completed addresses the practical and emotional dimensions of ending consulting engagements. He emphasises that disengagement is a process to be managed, not just a point in time.

    <li>How does Block suggest consultants should handle the emotional aspects of disengagement?</li>
    <li>What role does feedback play in Block's model of project completion?</li>

### Case study

:::reading[core][oshea1997]
O'Shea and Madigan's chapter tells the story of Figgie International, a Fortune 500 conglomerate that paid over $75 million in consulting fees between 1989 and 1994 to firms including Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen Consulting. The goal was to transform Figgie into a "world-class manufacturer." Instead, the company nearly went bankrupt, thousands of employees lost their jobs, and Figgie eventually sued the consultants.

The case is valuable because responsibility is genuinely shared: Harry Figgie's autocratic management style, the consultants' failure to challenge unrealistic expectations, scope creep across multiple overlapping engagements, and a lack of honest evaluation all contributed. As you read, pay attention to the warning signs that emerged during the engagements and consider what the consultants could — and should — have done differently.

### Optional listening

:::reading[optional]
Dubner, S. (2020) &ldquo;Does Advertising Actually Work?&rdquo; *Freakonomics Radio*, Episodes 440&ndash;441. [Listen online](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/does-advertising-actually-work-part-1-tv-ep-440/)

This two-part podcast explores an uncomfortable question: does the advertising industry&mdash;which spends over $250 billion annually in the US alone&mdash;actually know whether its spending is effective? The parallels to consulting evaluation are striking. Tuchman, Shapiro &amp; Hitsch's large-scale empirical study finds TV advertising is roughly 15&ndash;20 times less effective than the conventional wisdom suggests, while Tadelis's experiments at eBay showed the company was losing money on most of its paid-search advertising. Yet firms continue to spend because of principal-agent problems (marketing directors won't undermine their own roles), the file-drawer problem (null results go unpublished), and circular reasoning (&ldquo;companies wouldn't spend billions if it didn't work&rdquo;). Listen with the evaluation paradox in mind: the same dynamics&mdash;misaligned incentives, difficulty of causal attribution, and organisational reluctance to test cherished assumptions&mdash;help explain why rigorous evaluation remains rare in consulting.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Listen with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What parallels do you see between the advertising industry's evaluation challenges and consulting's?</li>
    <li>Why did eBay's own staff resist the experimental evidence that their advertising wasn't working?</li>
    <li>What does Levitt's observation that &ldquo;firms are composed of people&rdquo; imply for consulting evaluation?</li>
  </ul>

### Optional readings

:::reading[optional][dawsonbuchanan2005]
Dawson and Buchanan argue that organisational change produces competing narratives, with different stakeholders telling different stories about what happened and why. Important for understanding the political dimensions of evaluation.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Why do multiple narratives emerge about the same change process?</li>
    <li>How do power dynamics influence which narrative becomes "official"?</li>
    <li>What implications does this have for how consultants should approach evaluation?</li>
  </ul>

:::reading[optional][lovallo2003]
Lovallo and Kahneman explain why major initiatives systematically fail to meet expectations, tracing the problem to cognitive biases in planning and forecasting. Relevant to understanding why evaluation often produces disappointing results. [Access via HBR](https://hbr.org/2003/07/delusions-of-success-how-optimism-undermines-executives-decisions)

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What cognitive biases lead to overly optimistic planning?</li>
    <li>What is the "outside view" and how does it help?</li>
    <li>How should this influence how consultants set expectations with clients?</li>
  </ul>

:::reading[optional][fleischer2014]
Fleischer, Knyphausen-Aufseß and Schweizer examine how consulting performance can be measured and whether success fees provide appropriate incentives. Relevant to evaluation and commercial aspects of consulting.

<div class="reading-questions">
  <div class="label">Read with these questions in mind</div>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the arguments for and against success-based fees in consulting?</li>
    <li>What measurement challenges do success fees create?</li>
    <li>In what circumstances might success fees be appropriate?</li>

### Why these perspectives matter

Block writes as a practitioner offering normative advice on how to conclude engagements well. The APM research provides empirical evidence on handover practices. Heusinkveld and Benders offer a critical academic perspective on knowledge commodification.

The O'Shea and Madigan case study, while from 1997, remains powerful because it illustrates dynamics that continue today: scope creep, dependency creation, misaligned incentives, and diffused accountability.

Together, these readings illuminate the technical, political, and ethical dimensions of concluding consulting work.

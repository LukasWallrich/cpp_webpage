### Knowledge as consultancy's core asset

:::summary
Consultancies sell knowledge, and their value lies in **what their people know**. The fundamental challenge: the most valuable knowledge (tacit knowledge, judgement, intuition) is the hardest to capture.
:::

Unlike product companies, consultancies have no inventory, no factories, no physical assets of significant value. Knowledge takes different forms in consulting:

| Knowledge type | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Explicit** | Codified, documented, shareable | Methodologies, frameworks, templates |
| **Tacit** | Personal, experiential, hard to articulate | Judgement about client dynamics, intuition about what will work |
| **Embedded** | Built into processes and systems | Firm's approach to scoping, quality assurance procedures |

### Knowledge management fundamentals

The following framework goes beyond the video with a detailed breakdown of the knowledge management cycle.

:::framework
**Knowledge management** involves transforming individual project experience into accumulated organisational knowledge through:

1. **Capture**: Documenting what was learned
2. **Storage**: Organising knowledge so it can be found
3. **Retrieval**: Making knowledge accessible when needed
4. **Distribution**: Getting knowledge to where it's useful
5. **Application**: Using knowledge in new contexts
:::

This requires both **people** (who share knowledge through conversations, mentoring, and collaboration) and **systems** (databases, intranets, search tools) that support knowledge flows.

### The commodification process

:::summary
**Commodification** turns bespoke consulting work into standardised, reusable products. Heusinkveld & Benders [-@heusinkveld2005] show this process is **deeply political**, involving internal legitimation struggles.
:::

The literature on management knowledge production (e.g., Abrahamson, [-@abrahamson1996]; Huczynski, [-@huczynski1993]) describes three key activities, as reviewed by Heusinkveld & Benders [-@heusinkveld2005]:

1. **Codifying**: Writing down what was learned in reusable form
2. **Abstracting**: Removing client-specific details to create general principles
3. **Translating**: Packaging knowledge for different audiences and markets

Commodification isn't just about clients — it involves **internal politics** within consulting firms. Partners may resist sharing knowledge that gives them competitive advantage, practice leaders compete for resources, junior consultants may see codification as threatening their value, and knowledge management teams struggle to get consultants to contribute. New concepts must achieve internal legitimacy before they can succeed in the market; failed commodification efforts often fail internally before ever reaching clients.

<!-- Summary generated from PDF: sources/heusinkveld2005.pdf -->
:::source[heusinkveld2005]
Stefan Heusinkveld and Jos Benders examine how management consultancies develop and package new concepts for market, finding that the process involves significant internal struggle before products reach clients.

**Key findings/arguments**:
- Knowledge commodification is not simply a technical process but involves internal legitimation struggles within consultancies
- Consultants face tensions between customisation (valued by clients) and standardisation (efficient for the firm)
- New concepts must gain "good currency" internally before they can be successfully marketed externally
- Product champions within consultancies play crucial roles in driving commodification efforts forward despite organisational resistance
- The process reveals consultancies as sites of contested knowledge development, not just knowledge application

**Key insight**: Packaging consulting knowledge into products is a political process within firms, not just a technical one. Internal acceptance precedes market success.

### Benefits and risks of commodification

The tables below provide detail beyond the video's discussion of the key trade-offs.

**For the consulting firm:**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Efficiency** | Reuse reduces reinvention; projects start faster |
| **Quality** | Proven approaches reduce risk of failure |
| **Scalability** | Less senior people can deliver more work |
| **Marketing** | Named products create differentiation |
| **Training** | Codified knowledge eases onboarding |

**For clients:**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Proven solutions** | Confidence the approach has worked before |
| **Faster delivery** | No need to develop methodology from scratch |
| **Benchmarking** | Comparison with how others have addressed similar problems |
| **Predictability** | Clearer sense of what to expect |

:::summary
Commodification also creates risks and ethical challenges — for consultancies (price pressure, loss of tacit knowledge) and for clients (poor fit, methodology prioritised over needs).
:::

Packaging and selling solutions raises ethical questions around **transparency** (are clients aware they're getting a standardised product?), **fit** (is it recommended because it suits the client, or because it's what the firm sells?), **intellectual property** (whose knowledge is being commodified?), and **currency** (how up-to-date is the packaged knowledge?).

**The "problem-chasing" perspective**: Recall from Week 2 Sturdy's [-@sturdy2018b] analysis of consultants as promoters of "solutions in search of problems." Commodification intensifies this dynamic. When consultants have invested in developing a packaged solution, they have incentives to frame client problems in terms the solution can address, downplay aspects it doesn't cover, and recommend their product even when bespoke work might be better. This isn't necessarily cynical — consultants may genuinely believe their approach is effective — but it creates blind spots.

### GenAI and the future of knowledge capture

:::summary
Generative AI, particularly retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems built over internal knowledge bases, is reshaping the economics of knowledge capture. These systems don't create new knowledge, but they make captured knowledge **dramatically more accessible**.
:::

This has different implications depending on where you sit:

- **Large firms** benefit most from systematic codification: every project report, methodology document, and case study becomes instantly searchable. The return on investment in knowledge capture increases when retrieval is effortless.
- **Freelance and small consultants** may find their tacit knowledge advantage grows. Large firms can RAG their explicit knowledge, but relationship judgement, contextual sensitivity, and the ability to read a room remain distinctly human.
- **Clients** may find that general consulting frameworks become more accessible via AI, potentially shifting demand toward more bespoke, high-judgement consulting work.

The tensions Heusinkveld & Benders identified persist in this new context: whose knowledge gets captured? Who benefits from its reuse? What gets lost when tacit expertise is reduced to searchable text?

### Finding the balance

Effective consulting firms balance:

- **Leverage** (reusing what they know) with **customisation** (adapting to client context)
- **Efficiency** (standardised approaches) with **effectiveness** (solutions that actually work)
- **Product marketing** (named methodologies) with **honest assessment** (what's really needed here)

The best consultants use frameworks as **thinking tools** (recall Week 4-5 discussion) rather than recipes to be applied mechanically.

:::reflect
Think about a situation where you received a standardised service (consulting or otherwise). Did it feel appropriate for your needs, or did it feel like you were being fitted to the product rather than the product being fitted to you?

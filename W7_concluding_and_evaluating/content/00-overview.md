## Overview

This week focuses on the **concluding phase** of the consultancy cycle: disengagement, evaluation, and knowledge capture. Building on Week 6's implementation content, we explore how consultants bring engagements to a close, assess their impact, and capture learning for future work.

:::outcomes
- Plan how to manage for a positive disengagement throughout the consultancy cycle
- Recognise opportunities and challenges in evaluating consultancy interventions
- Identify strategies to ensure learning and review at the end of an engagement
- Recognise opportunities and challenges in capturing knowledge and commoditising your learning

### Position in the consultancy cycle

We're now at the **final phase** of the consultancy cycle, bringing us full circle back to where we began. This phase connects directly to Week 2's contracting content: what you agree at the start shapes how you can conclude effectively.

Remember: **disengagement planning starts early, not at the end**. The handover expectations you set during contracting (Week 2) determine what's possible now. If you haven't built in time for capability transfer or agreed success criteria, you'll struggle to demonstrate value or leave the client self-sufficient.

### How to use these materials

To prepare for the live session, you should:

1. **Watch the video recordings** and review the written content that highlights key points
2. **Read Block [-@block2011] Chapter 21** (required for all) and **at least one further core reading**: the APM handover report [@apm2017] OR Heusinkveld & Benders [-@heusinkveld2005]
3. **Read the O'Shea & Madigan case study** on Figgie International for our ethics discussion
4. **Work through the preparation checklist** at the end

The expandable academic source summaries throughout these materials are **optional enrichment**. They provide deeper context if you're interested, but aren't essential for the live session.

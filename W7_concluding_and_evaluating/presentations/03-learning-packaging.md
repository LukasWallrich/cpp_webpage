# Part 3: Capturing and Commoditising Knowledge
**Target duration: ~15-20 minutes**

## Narrative Arc
This final part shifts from client-facing disengagement to the firm-level question of knowledge capture. It explains why knowledge management matters strategically for consulting firms, introduces commodification as a contested political process (not just a technical one), and considers what generative AI means for this landscape. The detailed frameworks (knowledge types, benefits/risks tables) are in the written content.

## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 1: Part 3 Title
**Content**: "Capturing and Commoditising Knowledge"
- From individual project learning to organisational assets
- The contested nature of turning experience into products

---

### Slide 2: Knowledge as Consultancy's Core Asset
**Content**: What consultancies actually sell

**Story to tell**:
- No inventory, no factories, no significant physical assets
- Value lies in what people know and their ability to apply it
- This makes knowledge management strategic, not just operational
- The fundamental challenge: the most valuable knowledge is often the hardest to capture
- **Tacit knowledge**—knowing how, not just knowing what—is where real expertise lives
- You can codify a methodology, but can you codify the judgement to know when it doesn't apply?
- **Embedded knowledge**—built into processes, routines, and systems—is equally hard to capture because people may not even recognise it as knowledge
- Think about your own way of working: what makes a difference that you couldn't easily write down in a manual? That's tacit. And what's baked into how your team or organisation operates, almost invisibly? That's embedded.

### Slide 3: The Commodification Process
**Content**: How bespoke work becomes standardised products

**Definition**: Commodification = turning bespoke consulting work into standardised, reusable products

**Story to tell**:
- The literature describes three key activities: codifying (writing down), abstracting (removing client specifics), translating (packaging for audiences)
- This is how consulting firms build leverage—reusing what they learn
- Think of familiar examples: McKinsey's Organizational Health Index, BCG's growth-share matrix, Bain's Net Promoter Score
- These all started as insights from specific engagements, then got packaged
- The process sounds technical but is actually deeply political

### Slide 4: Contested Commodification
**Content**: Heusinkveld & Benders' key findings

**Story to tell**:
- Heusinkveld & Benders (2005) studied how consultancies actually develop new concepts
- Key finding: commodification involves internal legitimation struggles
- New concepts must gain "good currency" internally before market launch
- Product champions drive efforts forward despite resistance
- Partners may resist sharing knowledge that gives them competitive advantage
- Junior consultants may see codification as threatening—if it's in the system, why do they need me?
- Knowledge management teams struggle to get consultants to contribute
- Knowledge is power—sharing it isn't always in individuals' interests
- Failed commodification efforts often fail internally before ever reaching clients

---

### Slide 5: Solutions in Search of Problems
**Content**: The "problem-chasing" dynamic

**Story to tell**:
- Recall from Week 2: Sturdy (2018) on consultants as co-constructors of problems and solutions
- Commodification intensifies this: when you've invested in a packaged solution, you have incentives to frame client problems in terms your solution can address
- "Hammer looking for nails" syndrome
- This isn't necessarily cynical—consultants may genuinely believe their approach works
- But it creates blind spots: aspects of the problem the methodology doesn't cover get downplayed
- The best consultants use frameworks as thinking tools, not recipes (recall Week 4-5)

---

### Slide 6: Ethical Dimensions
**Content**: Questions worth discussing

**Key ethical questions**:
1. **Transparency**: Are clients aware they're getting a standardised product? Is this reflected in pricing?
2. **Fit**: Is the packaged solution genuinely appropriate, or recommended because it's what the firm sells?
3. **Intellectual property**: Whose knowledge is being commodified? If developed with Client A, does Client A have a claim?
4. **Currency**: How up to date is the packaged knowledge? Methods from five years ago may no longer apply.

**Story to tell**:
- These aren't theoretical concerns—they create real dilemmas in practice
- The Figgie International case (which we'll discuss in the live session) shows what happens when solutions are applied without adequate regard for fit
- Transparency about standardisation can affect willingness to pay—so there's a financial incentive not to be transparent

### Slide 7: GenAI and the Future of Knowledge Capture
**Content**: How generative AI is reshaping this landscape

**Story to tell**:
- Consulting firms are increasingly building RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) systems over their internal knowledge bases
- This doesn't create new knowledge, but it makes captured knowledge far more accessible and searchable
- The return on investment in knowledge capture increases dramatically when retrieval is effortless
- For large firms: this strengthens the case for systematic codification—every project report, methodology document, and case study becomes instantly searchable
- For freelance and small consultants: the tacit knowledge advantage may actually grow. Large firms can RAG their explicit knowledge, but relationship judgement, contextual sensitivity, and the ability to read a room remain human
- For clients: if general consulting frameworks become accessible via AI, does demand shift toward more bespoke, high-judgement work?
- The H&B tensions remain: whose knowledge gets captured? Who benefits? What gets lost in translation?

### Slide 8: Part 3 Summary and Week Wrap-Up
**Content**: Recap of the whole week

**What we covered in Part 3**:
- Knowledge as consultancy's core asset
- Commodification as a contested, political process
- The "problem-chasing" dynamic
- Ethical dimensions of packaging solutions
- How genAI is reshaping knowledge capture

**Week 7 overall**:
- Evaluation: the tension between proving and learning
- Disengagement: planning for positive endings
- Knowledge capture: turning experience into assets

**The connecting thread**: The concluding phase of consulting is not just about ending—it's about learning, leaving well, and building for the future.

**Live session focus**: We'll discuss the Figgie International case in depth—who bears responsibility when consulting goes badly wrong?

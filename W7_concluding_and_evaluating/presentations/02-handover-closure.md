# Part 2: Planning for Positive Disengagement
**Target duration: ~15-20 minutes**

## Narrative Arc
This part focuses on why endings matter disproportionately, what makes handovers fail, and the human dimension of closure. The APM research provides the evidence base, but the presentation focuses on the key insights rather than listing all 12 recommendations (which are covered in the written content). The goal is to make the audience think about endings as something to plan for, not something that just happens.

## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 1: Part 2 Title
**Content**: "Planning for Positive Disengagement"
- How you end an engagement shapes everything that follows
- Connection to W2: most work comes from existing clients or referrals

---

### Slide 2: Why Closure Matters
**Content**: The lasting impact of endings

**Story to tell**:
- Final interactions carry disproportionate weight in how clients remember the engagement
- Think of your own experience: you remember how things ended more vividly than the middle
- Recall W2's discussion of repeat business and referrals—your ending is your marketing
- Even difficult projects can end well if closure is handled properly
- Cockman, Evans & Reynolds (1999): acting professionally throughout—including the conclusion—is essential for building trust

---

### Slide 3: When to Say Goodbye
**Content**: Signals that it's time to disengage

**Story to tell**:
- The ideal ending: the client is ready to continue without you
- Block (2011): "aim to work yourself out of a job"
- Key signals: objectives achieved, client capability built, diminishing returns
- If the client remains dependent on you, you haven't succeeded—regardless of how much revenue that dependency generates
- Sometimes the right answer is to leave before the budget runs out

### Slide 4: Why Handovers Fail
**Content**: The APM research headline findings

**Story to tell**:
- APM Research Fund (2017) studied handover across major projects (Crossrail, Transport for London, AWE/Ministry of Defence)
- The consistent finding: handover fails when it's treated as an afterthought—a final rush before the next project
- The most common failure: treating handover as a single event rather than a process
- If you've spent months developing a solution, don't expect the client to absorb it in a single meeting
- Meyer & Stensaker (2006): organisations have limited "change capacity"—they can only absorb so much at once

---

### Slide 5: Common Handover Failures
**Content**: What goes wrong and why — stories, not just a list

**Story to tell**:
- No overlap period: the consultant leaves and the client has questions with nobody to ask. By the time the problem surfaces, the consultant is deep into another engagement.
- Documentation only: a 200-page report handed over on the last day. Nobody reads it. The tacit knowledge—the judgement calls, the relationships, the "why we did it this way"—walks out the door.
- Wrong people in the room: the senior sponsor attends the handover meeting, but the people who will actually implement the changes weren't invited. They inherit something they don't understand.
- Single handover meeting: too much information compressed into too little time. Everyone nods, nobody retains.
- The key insight from APM: handover must be planned from the start and resourced adequately—it's not a free add-on at the end.

### Slide 6: Creating Closure Opportunities
**Content**: Block's recommendations for positive endings

**Three key activities** (Block, 2011, Chapter 21):
1. **Project reviews**: Structured reflection on achievements and challenges
2. **Feedback in both directions**: What did the client value? What could we do differently?
3. **Team celebrations**: Acknowledging completion, recognising contributions

**Story to tell**:
- These aren't just nice-to-haves—they serve practical purposes
- Reviews capture learning while it's fresh
- Two-way feedback improves future engagements
- Even if the project had difficulties, closure rituals matter
- Disengagement is also an opportunity for learning: What worked? What would we do differently? What did we learn about this industry?

---

### Slide 7: The Emotional Dimension
**Content**: Acknowledging the human side of endings

**Story to tell**:
- Long engagements create genuine working relationships
- Endings involve loss as well as achievement—for consultants and clients alike
- Clients may have mixed feelings about your departure: relief that the disruption is ending, but also concern about managing alone
- Allow time for proper goodbyes. Express appreciation genuinely.
- Don't rush the ending just because "the work is done"
- Taking time for closure is part of professional practice, not a luxury

---

### Slide 8: Part 2 Summary
**Content**: Recap and preview

**What we covered**:
- Why closure matters for reputation and future work
- Signals that it's time to disengage
- Why handovers fail: the afterthought problem
- Creating closure opportunities
- The emotional dimension of endings

**The connecting thread**: Positive disengagement requires intentional planning throughout the engagement, not just at the end. How you leave shapes how you're remembered.

**Reflection**: Think about a project or job that ended well. What made the ending feel complete? What about one that ended poorly—what was missing?

**Preview of Part 3**: How do consultancies capture knowledge? The process of commodification. Benefits and risks of packaging solutions.

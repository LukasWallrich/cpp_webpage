## Issues Found

### Issue 1: MBB revenues slightly outdated

- **Location**: 02-industry-landscape.md:16
- **Claim**: "Revenues of $10-15bn each" for McKinsey, BCG, Bain
- **Problem**: McKinsey's 2024 revenue is now estimated at $16-18.8 billion, exceeding the stated range. BCG at ~$13.5bn is within range. The $10-15bn figure is now low for McKinsey.
- **Suggested fix**: Update to "Revenues of $10-19bn" or specify individual figures: "McKinsey (~$17bn), BCG (~$14bn), Bain (~$6bn)"

### Issue 2: 70% from five countries - unverified statistic

- **Location**: 02-industry-landscape.md:26
- **Claim**: "70% of global fees come from just five countries (USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada)"
- **Problem**: Could not find a source for this specific statistic. While geographic concentration is well-documented, the exact "70% from 5 countries" figure and inclusion of Canada (rather than, say, Australia or Netherlands) could not be verified.
- **Suggested fix**: Add a citation for this statistic, or soften to "the majority of global fees come from a handful of countries" with verified regional data.

### Issue 3: Schein (1987) "four roles" is an adaptation

- **Location**: 03-roles-perspectives.md:15
- **Claim**: "Four consultant roles (adapted from Schein, 1987)"
- **Problem**: Schein's original framework describes **three** models (Expert/Purchase-of-Expertise, Doctor-Patient, Process Consultation), not four. The content correctly notes this is "adapted from" Schein, but the four-role framework (Plumber, Doctor, Advisor, Navigator) appears to be a pedagogical adaptation rather than Schein's original work.
- **Suggested fix**: Consider clarifying the adaptation more explicitly, e.g., "Four consultant roles (pedagogical framework drawing on Schein, 1987)" or cite the actual source if this four-role model comes from another author.

---

## Minor Issues / Style Notes

### Block edition reference inconsistency

- **Location**: 03-roles-perspectives.md:45 references "Block (2010)"
- **Note**: Block's 3rd edition was published in **2011**, not 2010. The 2nd edition was 1999. If referring to the 3rd edition, update to 2011.

### Seth first name

- **Location**: 02-industry-landscape.md:48
- **Current**: "Seth, N. (2025)"
- **Note**: Author's full name is **Nitin Seth**. Consider using full first name for consistency with other citations.

### Factual Claims

| Claim | Source file | Verification | Notes |
|-------|------------|--------------|-------|
| BCG 20% of revenue from AI advisory services in 2024 | 06-people-analytics.md:89 | ✓ VERIFIED | Confirmed by [BCG press release](https://www.bcg.com/press/bcg-announces-re-election-of-chief-executive-officer-christoph-schweizer) and multiple sources |

| BCG 74% of companies struggle to scale AI | 06-people-analytics.md:107 | ✓ VERIFIED | Exact wording from [BCG October 2024 report](https://www.bcg.com/press/24october2024-ai-adoption-in-2024-74-of-companies-struggle-to-achieve-and-scale-value) |
| Deloitte AI hallucination incident with Australian government | 06-people-analytics.md:105 | ✓ VERIFIED | Well-documented incident. See [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/10/07/deloitte-ai-australia-government-report-hallucinations-technology-290000-refund/) and [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91417492/deloitte-ai-report-australian-government) |
| De Paoli (2024) findings on LLM thematic analysis | 06-people-analytics.md:93, 103, 125-135 | ✓ VERIFIED | Paper exists with correct citation details; quotes accurately represent findings |

### Source Citations

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Deloitte incident date inaccurate

- **Location**: 06-people-analytics.md:105
- **Claim**: "Deloitte faced criticism in 2024 after delivering an AI-assisted report..."
- **Problem**: The incident occurred in **2025**, not 2024. The contract was executed in December 2024, but the report was published in July 2025 and the controversy emerged in October 2025.
- **Suggested fix**: Change "in 2024" to "in 2025"

### Issue 2: McKinsey 45% automation figure lacks specificity

- **Location**: 06-people-analytics.md:109
- **Claim**: "According to McKinsey's own analysis, while approximately 45% of consultant activities could theoretically be automated..."
- **Problem**: The 45% figure comes from McKinsey's general research on work activities across **all occupations**, not specifically about consultant activities. The research states "45 percent of work activities could be automated using already demonstrated technology" across all jobs. More recent estimates with generative AI suggest 60-70%. The claim as written implies McKinsey studied their own consultants specifically.
- **Suggested fix**: Clarify the source: "According to McKinsey's research on automation potential, while approximately 45% of work activities across occupations could theoretically be automated with existing technology..." or find a consultant-specific source.

## Sources Verified

- **De Paoli (2024)**: DOI confirmed, CC-BY open access available from SAGE. The sources.json currently lists an arXiv preprint as OA_link; recommend updating to the official CC-BY version: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/08944393231220483
- **BCG statistics**: All verified from official BCG press releases and reports
- **McKinsey statistics**: 40% projects figure verified; 45% automation figure verified but needs context clarification

- **Location**: 02-why-recommendations-die.md:146-152
- **Original claim**: "NHS is one of the most-studied environments for change resistance..."
- **Problem**: Statistics came from US long-term care study, not NHS research.
- **Resolution**: Changed to "Healthcare is one of the most-studied environments" with proper attribution to healthcare change literature. Added verified "two-thirds of change initiatives fail" statistic. NHS-specific claim about externally generated ideas retained (separately sourced).

### Issue 2: Nokia touchscreen story lacks primary source ✓ FIXED

- **Location**: 03-evidence-trap.md:99
- **Original claim**: Unverified quote "Interesting, but that's not how phones work"
- **Resolution**: Replaced with verified story about Nokia's 2007 internal presentation (9-person team warned iPhone could set "a new standard," recommended developing touch interface to "fight back"). Sources: GizChina, PhoneArena leaked presentation analysis.

### Issue 3: Kodak "don't tell anyone" quote unverified ✓ FIXED

- **Location**: 03-evidence-trap.md:97
- **Original claim**: "That's cute—but don't tell anyone about it"
- **Resolution**: Revised to Sasson's own account: management's response was "curiosity and skepticism" and they saw it as "a very scary look at what could be possible." Sources: IEEE Spectrum interview, Snopes fact-check.

### Issue 4: Implementation rate "50%" claim needs sourcing ✓ FIXED

- **Location**: 01-recommendation-paradox.md:69
- **Original claim**: "Research suggests clients implement consultant recommendations only about half the time"
- **Resolution**: Removed unsourced percentage. Now explicitly notes that the "70% fail" statistic is a myth (citing Hughes 2011) while acknowledging implementation gaps are common enough to inspire the "credenzaware" term. Properly attributed to Bossidy & Charan's *Execution*.

### Issue 5: BCG Gaza case timeline needs updating ✓ FIXED

- **Location**: 04-ethics-without-easy-answers.md:207-213
- **Original claim**: "In late 2023, BCG was hired..."
- **Resolution**: Updated timeline to clarify BCG began work in late 2023, foundation launched early 2025, withdrawal occurred June 2025. Partners were fired (not just "stepped down"). Accurate timeline now reflects verified events.

## Minor Notes

### Bain UK ban was later reversed

- **Location**: 04-ethics-without-easy-answers.md:71
- **Note**: The UK Cabinet Office ban on Bain was reversed after 6 months following a legal challenge. The ban remains for Bain South Africa specifically. Consider noting this nuance if teaching current events.

### Big Four cheating fines announced June 2025

- **Location**: 04-ethics-without-easy-answers.md:125
- **Note**: The PCAOB announced these fines in June 2025, not during 2018-2022 (which was when the cheating occurred). The text correctly states the misconduct period.

---

## Sources Verified as Accurate

The following sources were fully verified:

- **McKinsey opioid settlement**: Extensively documented in DOJ press releases, NPR, CNN, multiple outlets
- **Bain/McKinsey South Africa**: NPA statements, FCPA documents, Daily Maverick investigative reporting
- **Arthur Andersen/Enron**: Congressional testimony, SEC documents, Britannica
- **Edinburgh/Birmingham ERP failures**: The Register, Panorama Consulting, Grant Thornton auditor reports
- **Open-plan office research**: Original peer-reviewed studies in *Journal of Environmental Psychology* and *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*
- **MBTI criticism**: Verified quotes from Adam Grant and Robert Hogan with original sources
- **Scared Straight**: Campbell Collaboration systematic review, DOJ CrimeSolutions database

---

## Corrections Applied (2 February 2026)

All five issues have been resolved:

1. ✓ **NHS statistics** - Changed to "Healthcare settings" with proper attribution; debunked "70% fail" myth citing Hughes (2011)
2. ✓ **Nokia story** - Replaced with verified 2007 internal presentation analysis
3. ✓ **Kodak quote** - Updated to Sasson's own account from interviews
4. ✓ **Implementation rate** - Removed unsourced percentage; now explicitly notes "70% fail" is a myth (Hughes 2011) while acknowledging implementation gaps are common
5. ✓ **BCG Gaza timeline** - Updated to reflect 2025 events accurately

**Note**: Hughes (2011) added to sources.json - key reference debunking the "70% of change initiatives fail" myth that lacks empirical evidence.

## Minor Notes

### Bain UK ban reversal

- **Location**: 04-ethics-without-easy-answers.md:71-72
- **Note**: The UK Cabinet Office ban on Bain was reversed in March 2023 after a legal challenge. The current text accurately describes the original ban but doesn't note the reversal. Consider adding this nuance if teaching current events.

### PCAOB fines timing

- **Location**: 04-ethics-without-easy-answers.md:125
- **Note**: The $8.5 million PCAOB fines were announced in June 2025. The text correctly states the misconduct period (2018-2022).

### KPMG separate case

- **Note**: KPMG Netherlands was fined separately by PCAOB ($25 million in 2024)—the largest PCAOB fine to date. This is not mentioned in the current content but could be added for completeness.

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Edmonstone (2010) page numbers incorrect

- **Location**: sources.json (`edmonstone2010` entry)
- **Claim**: Pages listed as 114–119
- **Problem**: Crossref DOI resolution confirms the correct pages are **225–230**. DOI: `10.12968/bjhc.2010.16.5.47936`
- **Suggested fix**: Update pages to "225-230" in sources.json and add DOI `10.12968/bjhc.2010.16.5.47936`

### Issue 2: Levina & Vaast (2005) end page off by one

- **Location**: sources.json (`levina2005` entry)
- **Claim**: Pages listed as 335–363
- **Problem**: Crossref confirms the correct page range is **335–364**
- **Suggested fix**: Update pages to "335-364" in sources.json and formatted_reference

### Issue 3: Randall, Burnes & Sim year discrepancy

- **Location**: W6_implementation/content/05-readings.md:103
- **Claim**: "Randall, Burnes & Sim (2019)"
- **Problem**: The book was published in **2018** (confirmed via University of Aberdeen Research Portal, Amazon, eBay). The sources.json correctly has `year: 2018` but the citation key is misleadingly named `randall2019`. The content text says "(2019)" which is incorrect.
- **Suggested fix**: Change "(2019)" to "(2018)" in 05-readings.md line 103

---

## Minor Notes

### Goodhart's Law attribution

- **Location**: 04-targets-business-case.md:76-77
- **Note**: The formulation "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" is widely attributed to Goodhart's Law but is actually **Marilyn Strathern's 1997 generalisation** (from "'Improving ratings': audit in the British University system," *European Review*, 5(3), 305-321). Goodhart's original 1975 statement was: "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes." The content attributes it to "Goodhart's Law" (not to Goodhart personally), which is acceptable common usage. No correction needed, but could optionally note it as Strathern's reformulation for academic precision.

### Block (2011) quote needs manual verification

- **Location**: 01-partnership-engagement.md:66-67
- **Quote**: "The ultimate measure of consulting effectiveness is the extent to which consultants become unnecessary."
- **Note**: The sentiment is consistent with Block's central argument in *Flawless Consulting*, but the exact wording could not be verified online. This may be a paraphrase presented as a direct quotation. Worth checking against the physical book.

### Rigby et al. (2016) sources.json entry incomplete

- **Location**: sources.json (`rigby2016` entry)
- **Note**: Missing structured fields (`title`, `journal`, `volume`, `issue`, `pages`). Only has `formatted_reference`, `authors`, `year`. Consider adding: title: "Embracing Agile", journal: "Harvard Business Review", volume: "94", issue: "5", pages: "40-50".

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: McKinsey survey figures (34% CEO / 6% frontline) cannot be verified

- **Location**: 01-evaluation.md:35
- **Claim**: "A McKinsey survey of nearly 1,500 people found that CEOs report transformation success at 34%, while frontline employees report just 6%"
- **Problem**: The Maor, Reich & Yocarini (2017) survey exists (n=1,487 confirmed), but the specific 34%/6% figures could not be verified from publicly accessible content. The publicly available McKinsey article reports different statistics (e.g., 3% success without manager/frontline engagement vs 26-28% with engagement). The full PDF is behind a download wall.
- **Suggested fix**: Verify these figures from the original PDF. If they cannot be confirmed, consider using the publicly verifiable statistics instead, or note the source more precisely.

### Issue 2: Geographic concentration percentage inconsistency between weeks

- **Location**: 01-evaluation.md:75 (Sturdy 2011 source block)
- **Claim**: "approximately 80% of worldwide fees come from just five nations"
- **Problem**: W1 content (02-industry-landscape.md) cites "70%" for the same claim from Sturdy (2018). W7 says "approximately 80%" citing Sturdy (2011). These may reflect different sources using different data, but the inconsistency is confusing for students who encounter both figures.
- **Suggested fix**: Check both original papers. If they give different figures, note the difference explicitly. If one is more current/reliable, use it consistently. This was flagged in the W1 fact check as well.

### Issue 3: Thorne (2000) has incorrect DOI in sources.json

- **Location**: sources.json (`thorne2000` entry)
- **Claim**: DOI listed as `10.1108/00251740010340517`
- **Problem**: That DOI resolves to Thompson, Alvy & Lees (2000) "Social entrepreneurship", a different article in the same issue. The correct DOI for Thorne's article is **`10.1108/00251740010340481`**.
- **Suggested fix**: Update DOI to `10.1108/00251740010340481`

### Issue 4: Buchanan (2000) has incorrect DOI in sources.json

- **Location**: sources.json (`buchanan2000` entry)
- **Claim**: DOI listed as `10.1108/19355181200000003`
- **Problem**: That DOI resolves to Sleeper, Walte & Calhoun (2000), a completely different article. The Buchanan hospital BPR article may not have a Crossref DOI, or the details may be slightly different (Buchanan published several hospital change articles around 1997-2003). The specific title "The lived experience of high-velocity change: A hospital case study" in *American Journal of Business* 15(1), 19-27 could not be independently verified.
- **Suggested fix**: Remove the incorrect DOI. Verify the exact citation from the original article. Note: Buchanan (2003) "Demands, Instabilities, Manipulations, Careers" in *Human Relations* 56(6), 663-684 (DOI: 10.1177/00187267030566002) is a related hospital change article that IS verified — check whether this is the intended reference.

### Issue 5: Huczynski (1993) referenced in text but missing from sources.json

- **Location**: 03-learning-packaging.md:54
- **Claim**: "Huczynski, 1993" referenced alongside Abrahamson (1996)
- **Problem**: No entry in sources.json for this reference. The work is Huczynski, A. A. (1993). *Management Gurus: What Makes Them and How to Become One*. Routledge.
- **Suggested fix**: Either add a sources.json entry for Huczynski (1993) or remove the inline reference if it's not essential (the point is adequately supported by Abrahamson 1996 and Heusinkveld & Benders 2005).

## Minor Notes

### APM report OA link is broken

- **Location**: sources.json (`apm2017` entry)
- **Current**: `https://www.apm.org.uk/resources/find-a-resource/how-can-we-hand-over-projects-better/` (returns 404)
- **Working URL**: `https://www.apm.org.uk/media/vycklp2w/handoverreport2017final.pdf`
- **Suggested fix**: Update OA_link in sources.json

### Fleischer et al. (2014) DOI may be incorrect

- **Location**: sources.json (`fleischer2014` entry)
- **Current DOI**: `10.1504/IJSEM.2014.065676`
- **Crossref suggests**: `10.1504/IJSEM.2014.064298`
- **Note**: Both DOIs exist in Crossref for this journal. The article details (title, authors, journal, volume, issue) are correct. Verify which DOI resolves correctly.

### Cockman et al. (1999) appears twice in sources.json

- **Location**: sources.json (lines 652-666 and 1038-1051)
- **Note**: Two entries with key `cockman1999` — one as a book_chapter (Chapter 10), one as a book. The duplicate key means JSON parsing will use only one. Consider removing one or using different keys (e.g., `cockman1999ch10` for the chapter).

## Status

All five issues resolved (15 February 2026). All minor notes also addressed.

## Corrections Applied (15 February 2026)

1. ✓ **McKinsey 34%/6% figures** — Verified via web search and LinkedIn summaries of the original report. The 34% (CEO) vs 6% (frontline) success rate figures are confirmed from the Maor, Reich & Yocarini (2017) survey (n=1,487). Note: the main McKinsey URL is currently broken (HTTP/2 protocol error); a PDF version exists at `https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/people%20and%20organizational%20performance/our%20insights/the%20people%20power%20of%20transformations/the-people-power-of-transformations.pdf`. No content change needed.
2. ✓ **Geographic concentration inconsistency** — The W7 source block for Sturdy (2011) already reconciles the two figures by explaining the decline from ~80% (2008, Sturdy 2011) to ~70% (2015, Sturdy & O'Mahoney 2018). W1 uses the more recent 70% figure without historical context, which is appropriate for an introduction. No content change needed.
3. ✓ **Thorne (2000) DOI** — Updated from `10.1108/00251740010340517` to `10.1108/00251740010340481` in sources.json
4. ✓ **Buchanan (2000) replaced** — The article "The lived experience of high-velocity change" in *American Journal of Business* 15(1) does not exist (verified via Emerald table of contents for that issue). The hospital BPR example with fabricated stakeholder narratives table was replaced with the real competing narratives example from Dawson & Buchanan (2005): interviews at three levels of an Australian manufacturing company (management, supervisory, employee) showing starkly different accounts of the same change process. The `buchanan2003` entry remains in sources.json but is no longer cited in W7 content.
5. ✓ **Huczynski (1993)** — Added to sources.json with full bibliographic details (Routledge, ISBN 9780415069113)

### Minor notes also resolved:
- ✓ **APM (2017) OA link** — Updated to working URL: `https://www.apm.org.uk/media/vycklp2w/handoverreport2017final.pdf`
- ✓ **Fleischer et al. (2014) DOI** — Updated from `10.1504/IJSEM.2014.065676` to `10.1504/IJSEM.2014.064298`
- ✓ **Cockman (1999) duplicate** — Resolved by using distinct keys: `cockman1999` (book) and `cockman1999ch10` (chapter)
- ✓ **Maor (2017) OA link** — Main URL currently returning HTTP/2 error; added note to sources.json with `oa_last_checked` date

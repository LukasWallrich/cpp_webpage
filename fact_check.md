## Issues Found

### Issue 1: MBB revenues slightly outdated

- **Location**: 02-industry-landscape.md:16
- **Claim**: "Revenues of $10-15bn each" for McKinsey, BCG, Bain
- **Problem**: McKinsey's 2024 revenue is now estimated at $16-18.8 billion, exceeding the stated range. BCG at ~$13.5bn is within range. The $10-15bn figure is now low for McKinsey.
- **Suggested fix**: Update to "Revenues of $10-19bn" or specify individual figures: "McKinsey (~$17bn), BCG (~$14bn), Bain (~$6bn)"

### Issue 2: 70% from five countries - unverified statistic

- **Location**: 02-industry-landscape.md:26
- **Claim**: "70% of global fees come from just five countries (USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada)"
- **Problem**: Could not find a source for this specific statistic. While geographic concentration is well-documented, the exact "70% from 5 countries" figure and inclusion of Canada (rather than, say, Australia or Netherlands) could not be verified.
- **Suggested fix**: Add a citation for this statistic, or soften to "the majority of global fees come from a handful of countries" with verified regional data.

### Issue 3: Schein (1987) "four roles" is an adaptation

- **Location**: 03-roles-perspectives.md:15
- **Claim**: "Four consultant roles (adapted from Schein, 1987)"
- **Problem**: Schein's original framework describes **three** models (Expert/Purchase-of-Expertise, Doctor-Patient, Process Consultation), not four. The content correctly notes this is "adapted from" Schein, but the four-role framework (Plumber, Doctor, Advisor, Navigator) appears to be a pedagogical adaptation rather than Schein's original work.
- **Suggested fix**: Consider clarifying the adaptation more explicitly, e.g., "Four consultant roles (pedagogical framework drawing on Schein, 1987)" or cite the actual source if this four-role model comes from another author.

## Minor Issues / Style Notes

### Block edition reference inconsistency

- **Location**: 03-roles-perspectives.md:45 references "Block (2010)"
- **Note**: Block's 3rd edition was published in **2011**, not 2010. The 2nd edition was 1999. If referring to the 3rd edition, update to 2011.

### Seth first name

- **Location**: 02-industry-landscape.md:48
- **Current**: "Seth, N. (2025)"
- **Note**: Author's full name is **Nitin Seth**. Consider using full first name for consistency with other citations.
